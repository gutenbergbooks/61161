</div>

<hr class='c006' />

<p class='c007'>The following pages contain an account of the
principles upon which the public and political life
of our Anglosaxon forefathers was based, and of
the institutions in which those principles were most
clearly manifested. The subject is a grave and
solemn one: it is the history of the childhood of
our own age,—the explanation of its manhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>On every side of us thrones totter, and the deep
foundations of society are convulsed. Shot and
shell sweep the streets of capitals which have long
been pointed out as the chosen abodes of order:
cavalry and bayonets cannot control populations
whose loyalty has become a proverb here, whose
peace has been made a reproach to our own miscalled
disquiet. Yet the exalted Lady who wields
the sceptre of these realms, sits safe upon her
throne, and fearless in the holy circle of her domestic
happiness, secure in the affections of a people
whose institutions have given to them all the
blessings of an equal law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those institutions they have inherited from a
period so distant as to excite our admiration, and
have preserved amidst all vicissitudes with an enlightened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>will that must command our gratitude.
And with the blessing of the Almighty, they will
long continue to preserve them; for our customs
are founded upon right and justice, and are maintained
in a subjection to His will who hath the
hearts of nations as well as of kings in His rule
and governance.</p>

<p class='c001'>It cannot be without advantage for us to learn
how a State so favoured as our own has set about
the great work of constitution, and solved the
problem, of uniting the completest obedience to
the law with the greatest amount of individual freedom.
But in the long and chequered history of
our State, there are many distinguishable periods:
some more and some less well known to us. Among
those with which we are least familiar is the oldest
period. It seems therefore the duty of those whose
studies have given them a mastery over its details,
to place them as clearly as they can before the eyes
of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class='c001'>There have never been wanting men who enjoyed
a distinct insight into the value of our
earliest constitutional history. From the days of
Spelman, and Selden and Twisden, even to our
own, this country has seen an unbroken succession
of laborious thinkers, who, careless of self-sacrifice,
have devoted themselves to record the facts which
were to be recovered from the darkness of the past,
and to connect them with the progress of our political
and municipal laws. But peculiar advantages
over these men, to whom this country owes a large
debt of gratitude, are now enjoyed by ourselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>It is only within eight years that the “Ancient
Laws and Ecclesiastical Institutes” of the Anglosaxons
have been made fully accessible to us<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>:
within nine years only, upwards of fourteen hundred
documents containing the grants of kings
and bishops, the settlements of private persons, the
conventions of landlords and tenants, the technical
forms of judicial proceedings, have been placed in
our hands<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>; and to this last quarter of a century
has it been given to attain a mastery never before
attained over the language which our Anglosaxon
ancestors spoke. To us therefore it more particularly
belongs to perform the duty of illustrating
that period, whose records are furnished to us so
much more abundantly than they were to our predecessors;
and it seemed to me that this duty was
especially imposed upon him whom circumstances
had made most familiar with the charters of the
Anglosaxons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The history of our earliest institutions has come
down to us in a fragmentary form: in a similar way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>has it here been treated,—in chapters, or rather
essays, devoted to each particular principle or group
of facts. But throughout these fragments a system
is distinctly discernible: accordingly the chapters
will be found also to follow a systematic plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is my intention, at a future period, to lay
before my countrymen the continuation of this
History, embracing the laws of descent and purchase,
the law of contracts, the forms of judicial
process, the family relations, and the social condition
of the Saxons as to agriculture, commerce,
art, science and literature. I believe these things
to be worthy of investigation, from their bearing
upon the times in which we live, much more than
from any antiquarian value they may be supposed
to possess. We have a share in the past, and the
past yet works in us; nor can a patriotic citizen
better serve his country than by devoting his energies
and his time to record that which is great
and glorious in her history, for the admiration and
instruction of her neighbours.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE <br /> TO THE NEW EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The original edition of this monumental work
having for a long time been out of print and of
enhanced value, a great demand has arisen for the
issue of a new edition; and the welcome opportunity
of amending a number of oversights and
typographical errors, and of verifying a large number
of references, has not been neglected. The
book itself is of so standard a character, and was so
well digested in the first place, that no apology is
needed for its re-publication now—more than a
quarter of a century after its first appearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The principles laid down, the deductions gathered
from the array of recorded facts and examples, are
as true and incontrovertible to-day as they ever
were. The work, therefore, does not labour under
the disadvantage of becoming obsolete, inasmuch as
the researches which have since been made in this
branch of literary and historical enquiry have not
tended to weaken or destroy, but rather to support
and strengthen, the arguments applied by the author
to the gradual unfolding of his theories of the
growth and consolidation of the Anglosaxon Commonwealth,
and the Royal Authority in England.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>It is worthy of remembrance that one of the chief
authorities for the views advanced in this History
is the celebrated <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Codex Diplomaticus</cite></span>, the printing
of which occupied nine years of the author’s life.
The re-editing of that great work, under new arrangement,
with collations, and incorporation of a
large quantity of newly found material, has now
so clearly become a necessity, that steps should
be taken to re-publish the enormous collection of
documents relating to Anglosaxon times and Anglosaxon
history.</p>

<p class='c001'>No one can read the summary of Kemble’s investigations,
which is contained in the concluding
chapter to the First Volume, without feeling bound
to acknowledge that its pages contain the heartfelt
convictions of one who has spared no pains to
mature his own knowledge of the inner springs
which actuated the conduct of our forefathers’ lives
and advanced their culture, nor failed in his endeavour
to impart to his readers a correct view of
these important elements of our own manners and
customs;—in Kemble’s own words, “the history of
our childhood, the explanation of our manhood.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK I. <br /> THE ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT OF THE ANGLO-SAXON COMMONWEALTH.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER I. <br /> SAXON AND WELSH TRADITIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Eleven centuries ago, an industrious and conscientious
historian, desiring to give a record of the
establishment of his forefathers in this island, could
find no fuller or better account than this: “About
the year of Grace 445-446, the British inhabitants
of England, deserted by the Roman masters who
had enervated while they protected them, and exposed
to the ravages of Picts and Scots from the
extreme and barbarous portions of the island, called
in the assistance of heathen Saxons from the continent
of Europe. The strangers faithfully performed
their task, and chastised the Northern invaders;
then, in scorn of the weakness of their employers,
subjected them in turn to the yoke, and after various
vicissitudes of fortune, established their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>power upon the ruins of Roman and British civilization.”
The few details which had reached the
historian taught that the strangers were under the
guidance of two brothers, Hengest and Hors: that
their armament was conveyed in three ships or
keels: that it consisted of Jutes, Saxons and Angles:
that their successes stimulated similar adventurers
among their countrymen: and that in
process of time their continued migrations were so
large and numerous, as to have reduced Anglia,
their original home, to a desert<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the tale of the victorious Saxons in the
eighth century: at a later period, the vanquished
Britons found a melancholy satisfaction in adding
details which might brand the career of their conquerors
with the stain of disloyalty. According to
these hostile authorities, treachery and fraud prepared
and consolidated the Saxon triumph. The
wiles of Hengest’s beautiful daughter<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> subdued the
mind of the British ruler; a murderous violation
of the rights of hospitality, which cut off the chieftains
of the Britons at the very table of their hosts,
delivered over the defenceless land to the barbarous
invader<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>; and the miraculous intervention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Germanus, the spells of Merlin and the prowess
of Arthur, or the victorious career of Aurelius Ambrosius,
although they delayed and in part avenged,
yet could not prevent the <a id='corr3.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='downfal'>downfall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_3.4'><ins class='correction' title='downfal'>downfall</ins></a></span> of their people<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.
Meagre indeed are the accounts which thus satisfied
the most enquiring of our forefathers; yet such
as they are, they were received as the undoubted
truth, and appealed to in later periods as the earliest
authentic record of our race. The acuter criticism of
an age less prone to believe, more skilful in the appreciation
of evidence, and familiar with the fleeting
forms of mythical and epical thought, sees in them
only a confused mass of traditions borrowed from
the most heterogeneous sources, compacted rudely
and with little ingenuity, and in which the smallest
possible amount of historical truth is involved in a
great deal of fable. Yet the truth which such traditions
do nevertheless contain, yields to the alchemy
of our days a golden harvest: if we cannot
undoubtingly accept the details of such legends,
they still point out to us at least the course we
must pursue to discover the elements of fact upon
which the Mythus and Epos rest, and guide us to
the period and the locality where these took root
and flourished.</p>

<p class='c001'>From times beyond the records of history, it is
certain that continual changes were taking place in
the position and condition of the various tribes that
peopled the northern districts of Europe. Into this
great basin the successive waves of Keltic, Teutonic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and Slavonic migrations were poured, and here,
through hundreds of years, were probably reproduced
convulsions, terminated only by the great outbreak
which the Germans call <em>the wandering of the nations</em>.
For successive generations, the tribes, or even portions
of tribes, may have moved from place to
place, as the necessities of their circumstances demanded;
names may have appeared, and vanished
altogether from the scene; wars, seditions, conquests,
the rise and fall of states, the solemn formation
or dissolution of confederacies, may have filled
the ages which intervened between the first settlement
of the Teutons in Germany, and their appearance
in history as dangerous to the quiet of Rome.
The heroic lays<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a> may possibly preserve some shadowy
traces of these events; but of all the changes
in detail we know nothing: we argue only that
nations possessing in so preeminent a degree as
the Germans, the principles, the arts and institutions
of civilization, must have passed through a
long apprenticeship of action and suffering, and
have learnt in the rough school of practice the
wisdom they embodied in their lives.</p>

<p class='c001'>Possessing no written annals, and trusting to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>poet the task of the historian, our forefathers have
left but scanty records of their early condition<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.
Nor did the supercilious or unsuspecting ignorance
of Italy care to enquire into the mode of life and
habits of the barbarians until their strong arms
threatened the civilization and the very existence
of the empire itself. Then first, dimly through the
twilight in which the sun of Rome was to set for
ever, loomed the Colossus of the German race,
gigantic, terrible, inexplicable; and the vague attempt
to define its awful features came too late to
be fully successful. In Tacitus, the city possessed
indeed a thinker worthy of the exalted theme; but
his sketch, though vigorous beyond expectation, is
incomplete in many of the most material points:
yet this is the most detailed and fullest account
which we possess, and nearly the only certain
source of information till we arrive at the moment
when the invading tribes in every portion of the
empire entered upon their great task of reconstructing
society from its foundations. Slowly,
from point to point, and from time to time, traces
are recognized of powerful struggles, of national
movements, of destructive revolutions: but the
definite facts which emerge from the darkness of
the first three centuries are rare and fragmentary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us confine our attention to that portion of
the race which settled on our own shores.</p>

<p class='c001'>The testimony of contemporaneous history assures
us that about the middle of the fifth century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a considerable movement took place among the
tribes that inhabited the western coasts of Germany
and the islands of the Baltic sea. Pressed
at home by the incursions of restless neighbours,
and the urgency of increasing population, or yielding
to the universal spirit of adventure, Angles,
Saxons and Frisians crossed a little-known and
dangerous ocean to seek new settlements in adjacent
lands. Familiar as we are with daring deeds
of maritime enterprise, who have seen our flag float
over every sea, and flutter in every breeze that
sweeps over the surface of the earth, we cannot
contemplate without astonishment and admiration,
these hardy sailors, swarming on every point, traversing
every ocean, sweeping every æstuary and
bay, and landing on every shore which promised
plunder or a temporary rest from their fatigues.
The wealth of Gaul had already attracted fearful
visitations, and the spoils of Roman cultivation had
been displayed before the wondering borderers of
the Elbe and Eyder, the prize of past, and incentive
to future activity. Britain, fertile and defenceless,
abounding in the accumulations of a long
career of peace, deserted by its ancient lords, unaccustomed
to arms<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a>, and accustomed to the yoke,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>at once invited attack and held out the prospect of
a rich reward: and it is certain that at that period,
there took place some extensive migration of Germans
to the shores of England<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a>. The expeditions
known to tradition as those of Hengest, Ælli, Cissa,
Cerdic and Port, may therefore have some foundation
in fact; and around this meagre nucleus of
truth were grouped the legends which afterwards
served to conceal the poverty and eke out the
scanty stock of early history. But I do not think
it at all probable that this was the earliest period
at which the Germans formed settlements in England.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is natural to believe that for many centuries
a considerable and active intercourse had prevailed
between the southern and eastern shores of this
island, and the western districts of Gaul. The first
landing of Julius Caesar was caused or justified by
the assurance that his Gallic enemies recruited their
armies and repaired their losses, by the aid of their
British kinsmen and allies<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>; and the merchants of
the coast, who found a market in Britain, reluctantly
furnished him with the information upon
which the plan of his invasion was founded<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the fortune and the arms of Rome had prevailed
over her ill-disciplined antagonists, and both continent
and island were subject to the same all-embracing
rule, it is highly probable that the ancient
bonds were renewed, and that the most familiar
intercourse continued to prevail. In the time of
Strabo the products of the island, corn, cattle, gold,
silver and iron, skins, slaves, and a large description
of dog, were exported by the natives, no doubt
principally to the neighbouring coasts, and their
commerce with these was sufficient to justify the
imposition of an export and import duty<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. As early
as the time of Nero, London, though not a colony,
was remarkable as a mercantile station<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a>, and in all
human probability was the great mart of the Gauls.
There cannot be the least doubt that an active communication
was maintained throughout by the Keltic
nations on the different sides of the channel;
and similarly, as German tribes gradually advanced
along the lines of the Elbe, the Weser, the Maes
and the Rhine, occupying the countries which lie
upon the banks of those rivers, and between them
and the sea, it is reasonable to suppose that some
offsets of their great migrations reached the opposite
shores of England<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c008'><sup>[15]</sup></a>. As early as the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>century, Chauci are mentioned among the inhabitants
of the south-east of Ireland<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c008'><sup>[16]</sup></a>, and although we
have only the name whereby to identify them with
the great Saxon tribe, yet this deserves consideration
when compared with the indisputably Keltic
names of the surrounding races. The Coritavi, who
occupied the present counties of Lincoln, Leicester,
Rutland, Northampton, Nottingham and Derby,
were Germans, according to the Welsh tradition
itself<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c008'><sup>[17]</sup></a>, and the next following name Κατυευχλανοι,
though not certainly German, bears a strong resemblance
to many German formations<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c008'><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without, however, laying more stress upon these
facts than they will fairly warrant, let us proceed
to other considerations which render it probable
that a large admixture of German tribes was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in England long previous to the middle of the fifth
century. It appears to me that the presence of
Roman emperors recruiting the forces with which
the throne of the world was to be disputed, from
among the hardiest populations of the continent,
must not only have led to the settlement of Teutonic
families in this island, but also to the maintenance,
on their part, of a steady intercourse with
their kinsmen who remained behind. The military
colony, moreover, which claimed to be settled upon
good arable land, formed the easiest and most advantageous
mode of pensioning the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>emeriti</i></span>; and
many a successful Caesar may have felt that his
own safety was better secured by portioning his German
veterans in the fruitful valleys of England,
than by settling them as doubtful garrisons in
Lombardy or Campania.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fertile fields which long before had merited
the praises of the first Roman victor, must have offered
attractions enough to induce wandering Saxons
and Angles to desert the marshes and islands
of the Elbe, and to call Frisian adventurers over
from the sands and salt-pools of their home. If in
the middle of the fifth century Saxons had established
regular settlements at Bayeux<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c008'><sup>[19]</sup></a>; if even
before this time the country about Grannona bore
the name of Littus Saxonicum<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c008'><sup>[20]</sup></a>, we may easily believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>that at still earlier periods other Saxons had
found over the intervening ocean a way less dangerous
and tedious than a march through the territories
of jealous or hostile neighbours, or even
than a coasting voyage along barbarous shores
defended by a yet more barbarous population. A
north-east wind would, almost without effort of
their own, have carried their ships from Hêlgoland
and the islands of the Elbe, or from Silt and Romsey<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c008'><sup>[21]</sup></a>,
to the Wash and the coast of Norfolk. There
seems then every probability that bodies more or
less numerous, of coast-Germans, perhaps actually
of Saxons and Angles, had colonized the eastern
shores of England long before the time generally
assumed for their advent<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c008'><sup>[22]</sup></a>. The very exigencies of
military service had rendered this island familiar
to the nations of the continent: Batavi, under their
own national chieftains, had earned a share of the
Roman glory, and why not of the Roman land, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Britain<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c008'><sup>[23]</sup></a>? The policy of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus,
at the successful close of the Marcomannic
war, had transplanted to Britain multitudes of Germans,
to serve at once as instruments of Roman
power and as hostages for their countrymen on the
frontier of the empire<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c008'><sup>[24]</sup></a>. The remnants of this once
powerful confederation cannot but have left long
and lasting traces of their settlement among us; nor
can it be considered at all improbable that Carausius,
when in the year 287, he raised the standard of
revolt in Britain, calculated upon the assistance of
the Germans in this country, as well as that of their
allies and brethren on the continent<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c008'><sup>[25]</sup></a>. Nineteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>years later the death of Constantius delivered the
dignity of Caesar to his son Constantine: he was
solemnly elected to that dignity in Britain, and
among his supporters was Crocus, or as some read
Erocus, an Alamannic king who had accompanied
his father from Germany<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c008'><sup>[26]</sup></a>. Still later, under Valentinian,
we find an auxiliary force of Alamanni
serving with the Roman legions here.</p>

<p class='c001'>By chronological steps we have now approached
the period at which was compiled the celebrated
document entitled ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notitia utriusque imperii</span>’<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c008'><sup>[27]</sup></a>.
Even if we place this at the latest admissible date,
it is still at least half a century earlier than the earliest
date assigned to Hengest. Among the important
officers of state mentioned therein as administering
the affairs of this island, is the Comes Littoris
Saxonici per Britannias; and his government,
which extended from near the present site of Portsmouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to Wells in Norfolk<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c008'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, was supported by various
civil and military establishments, dispersed
along the whole sea-board. The term Littus Saxonicum
has been explained to mean rather the coast
visited by, or exposed to the ravages of, the Saxons,
than the coast occupied by them: but against
this loose system of philological and historical interpretation
I beg emphatically to protest: it seems
to have arisen merely from the uncritical spirit in
which the Saxon and Welsh traditions have been
adopted as ascertained facts, and from the impossibility
of reconciling the account of Beda with the
natural sense of the entry in the Notitia: but there
seems no reason whatever for adopting an exceptional
rendering in this case, and as the Littus Saxonicum
on the mainland was that district in which
members of the Saxon confederacy were settled, the
Littus Saxonicum per Britannias unquestionably
obtained its name from a similar circumstance<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c008'><sup>[29]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Thus far the object of this rapid sketch has been
to show the improbability of our earliest records
being anything more than ill-understood and confused
traditions, accepted without criticism by our
first annalists, and to refute the opinion long entertained
by our chroniclers, that the Germanic settlements
in England really date from the middle of
the fifth century. The results at which we have
arrived are far from unimportant; indeed they seem
to form the only possible basis upon which we can
ground a consistent and intelligible account of the
manner of the settlements themselves. And, be it
remembered, that the evidence brought forward
upon this point are the assertions of indifferent and
impartial witnesses; statesmen, soldiers, men of
letters and philosophers, who merely recorded
events of which they had full means of becoming
cognizant, with no object in general save that of
stating facts appertaining to the history of their
empire. Moreover, the accounts they give are probable
in themselves and perfectly consistent with
other well-ascertained facts of Roman history. Can
the same praise be awarded to our own meagre
national traditions, or to the fuller, detailed, but palpably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>uncritical assertions of our conquered neighbours?
I confess that the more I examine this
question, the more completely I am convinced that
the received accounts of our migrations, our subsequent
fortunes, and ultimate settlement, are devoid
of historical truth in every detail.</p>

<p class='c001'>It strikes the enquirer at once with suspicion
when he finds the tales supposed peculiar to his
own race and to this island, shared by the Germanic
populations of other lands, and with slight
changes of locality, or trifling variations of detail,
recorded as authentic parts of their history. The
readiest belief in fortuitous resemblances and coincidences
gives way before a number of instances
whose agreement defies all the calculation of
chances. Thus, when we find Hengest and Hors
approaching the coasts of Kent in three keels, and
Ælli effecting a landing in Sussex with the same
number, we are reminded of the Gothic tradition
which carries a migration of Ostrogoths, Visigoths
and Gepidae, also in three vessels, to the mouths
of the Vistula, certainly a spot where we do not
readily look for that recurrence to a trinal calculation,
which so peculiarly characterizes the modes of
thought of the Cymri. The murder of the British
chieftains by Hengest is told <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>totidem verbis</i></span> by
Widukind and others, of the Oldsaxons in Thuringia<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c008'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.
Geoffry of Monmouth relates also how Hengest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>obtained from the Britons as much land as
could be enclosed by an ox-hide; then, cutting the
hide into thongs, enclosed a much larger space
than the grantors intended, on which he erected
Thong castle<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c008'><sup>[31]</sup></a>—a tale too familiar to need illustration,
and which runs throughout the mythus of
many nations. Among the Oldsaxons the tradition
is in reality the same, though recorded with
a slight variety of detail. In their story, a lapful
of earth is purchased at a dear rate from a Thuringian;
the companions of the Saxon jeer him for
his imprudent bargain; but he sows the purchased
earth over a large space of ground, which he claims
and, by the aid of his comrades, ultimately wrests
from the Thuringians<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c008'><sup>[32]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the traditional history of the tribes peculiarly
belong the genealogies of their kings, to which it
will be necessary to refer hereafter in a mythological
point of view. For the present it is enough that I
call attention to the extraordinary tale of Offa,
who occurs at an early stage of the Mercian table,
among the progenitors of the Mercian kings. This
story, as we find it in Matthew Paris’s detailed account<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c008'><sup>[33]</sup></a>,
coincides in the minutest particulars with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>tale told by Saxo Grammaticus of a Danish prince
bearing the same name<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c008'><sup>[34]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The form itself in which details, which profess
to be authentic, have been preserved, ought to secure
us from falling into error. They are romantic,
not historical; and the romance has salient and
characteristic points, not very reconcilable with the
variety which marks the authentic records of fact.
For example, the details of a long and doubtful
struggle between the Saxons and the Britons are
obviously based upon no solid foundation; the dates
and the events are alike traditional,—the usual and
melancholy consolation of the vanquished. In proportion
as we desert the older and apply to later
sources of information, do we meet with successful
wars, triumphant British chieftains, vanquished
Saxons, heroes endowed with supernatural powers
and blessed with supernatural luck. Gildas, Nennius
and Beda mention but a few contests, and
even these of a doubtful and suspicious character;
Geoffry of Monmouth and gossipers of his class,
on the contrary, are full of wondrous incidents by
flood and field, of details calculated to flatter the
pride or console the sorrows of Keltic auditors: the
successes which those who lived in or near the
times described either pass over in modest silence
or vaguely insinuate under sweeping generalities,
are impudently related by this fabler and his copyists
with every richness of narration. According to
him the invaders are defeated in every part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>island, nay even expelled from it; army after army
is destroyed, chieftain after chieftain slain; till he
winds up his enormous tissue of fabrications with
the defeat, the capture and execution of a hero
whose very existence becomes problematical when
tested by the severe principles of historical criticism,
and who, according to the strict theory of
our times, can hardly be otherwise than enrolled
among the gods, through a godlike or half-godlike
form<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c008'><sup>[35]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is no doubt probable that the whole land
was not subdued without some pains in different
quarters; that here and there a courageous leader
or a favourable position may have enabled the
aborigines to obtain even temporary successes over
the invaders: the new immigrants were not likely
to find land vacant for their occupation among
their kinsmen who had long been settled here,
though well-assured of their co-operation in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>attempt to wrest new settlements from the British.
But no authentic record remains of the slow and
gradual progress that would have attended the conquest
of a brave and united people, nor is any such
consistent with the accounts the British authors
have left of the disorganized and disarmed condition
of the population. A skirmish, carried on by
very small numbers on either side, seems generally
to have decided the fate of a campaign. Steadily
from east to west, from south to north, the sharp
axes and long swords of the Teutons hewed their
way: wherever opposition was offered, it ended in
the retreat of the aborigines to the mountains,—fortresses
whence it was impossible to dislodge
them, and from which they sometimes descended
to attempt a hopeless effort for the liberty of their
country or revenge upon their oppressors. The
ruder or more generous of their number may have
preferred exile and the chances of emigration to
subjection at home<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c008'><sup>[36]</sup></a>; but the mass of the people,
accustomed to Roman rule or the oppression of
native princes<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c008'><sup>[37]</sup></a>, probably suffered little by a change
of masters, and did little to avoid it. At even a
later period an indignant bard could pour out his
patriotic reproaches upon the Loegrians who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>condescended to become Saxons. We learn that at
first the condition of the British under the German
rule was fair and easy, and only rendered harsher
in punishment of their unsuccessful attempts at
rebellion<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c008'><sup>[38]</sup></a>; and the laws of Ini, a Westsaxon king,
show that in the territories subject to his rule, and
bordering upon the yet British lands, the Welshman
occupied the place of a <em>perioecian</em> rather than
a <em>helot</em><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c008'><sup>[39]</sup></a>. Nothing in fact is more common, or less
true, than the exaggerated account of total exterminations
and miserable oppressions, in the traditional
literature of conquered nations; and we may
very safely appeal even to the personal appearance
of the peasantry in many parts of England, as evidence
how much Keltic blood was permitted to subsist
and even to mingle with that of the ruling Germans;
while the signatures to very early charters
supply us with names assuredly not Teutonic, and
therefore probably borne by persons of Keltic race,
occupying positions of dignity at the courts of
Anglosaxon kings<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c008'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>From what has preceded it will be inferred that
I look upon the genuine details of the German
conquests in England as irrevocably lost to us.
So extraordinary a success as the conquest of this
island by bands of bold adventurers from the continent,
whose cognate tribes had already come into
fatal collision with not only the Gallic provincials,
but even the levies of the city itself<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c008'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, could hardly
have passed unnoticed by the historians of the empire:
we have seen however that only Prosper Tyro
and Procopius notice this great event, and that
too in terms which by no means necessarily imply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>a state of things consistent with the received accounts.
The former only says indefinitely, that
<em>about</em> 441, Britain was finally reduced under the
Saxon power; while Procopius clearly shows how
very imperfect, indeed fabulous, an account he had
received<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c008'><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Could we trust the accuracy and critical
spirit of this writer, whom no less a man than
Gibbon has condescended to call the gravest historian
of his time, we might indeed imagine that we
had recovered one fact of our earliest history, which
brought with it all the attractions of romance. An
Angle princess had been betrothed to Radigér,
prince of the Varni, a Teutonic tribe whose seats
are subsequently described to have been about the
shores of the Northern Ocean and upon the Rhine,
by which alone they were separated from the
Franks<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c008'><sup>[43]</sup></a>. Tempted however partly by motives of
policy, partly perhaps by maxims of heathendom,
he deserted his promised bride and offered his hand
to Theodechild, the widow of his father, and sister
of the Austrasian Theodberht<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c008'><sup>[44]</sup></a>. Like the epic heroine
Brynhildr, the deserted lady was not disposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to pass over the affront thus offered to her charms.
With an immense armament she sailed for the
mouth of the Rhine. A victory placed the faithless
bridegroom a prisoner in her power. But desire of
revenge gave place to softer emotions, and the triumphant
princess was content to dismiss her rival
and compel her repentant suitor to perform his engagement.</p>

<p class='c001'>To deny all historical foundation to this tale
would perhaps be carrying scepticism to an unreasonable
extent. Yet the most superficial examination
proves that in all its details, at least, it is
devoid of accuracy. The period during which the
events described must be placed<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c008'><sup>[45]</sup></a>, is between the
years 534 and 547; and it is very certain that the
Varni were not settled at that time where Procopius
has placed them<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c008'><sup>[46]</sup></a>: on that locality we can
only look for Saxons. It is hardly necessary to say
that a fleet of four hundred ships, and an army of
one hundred thousand Angles, led by a woman, are
not data upon which we could implicitly rely in
calculating either the political or military power of
any English principality at the commencement of
the sixth century; or that ships capable of carrying
two hundred and fifty men each, had hardly been
launched at that time from any port in England.
Still I am not altogether disposed to deny the possibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of predatory expeditions from the more settled
parts of the island, adjoining the eastern coasts.
Gregory of Tours tells us that about the same time
as that assigned to this Angle expedition, Theodoric
the Frank, assisted by Sueves, Saxons and even
Bavarians, cruelly devastated the territory of the
Thuringians; and although it would be far more
natural to seek these Saxons in their old settlements
upon the continent, we have the authority
of Rudolf or Meginhart, that they were in fact inhabitants
of this island<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c008'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But if such difficulties exist in dealing with the
events of periods which are within the ascertained
limits of our chronological system, and which have
received the illustration of contemporary history,
what shall we say of those whereof the time, nay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>even the locality is unknown? What account shall
we render of those occurrences, which exist for us
only in the confused forms given to them by successive
ages; some, mischievously determined to
reduce the abnormal to rule, the extraordinary to
order, as measured by their narrow scheme of analogy?
Is it not obvious that to seek for historic
truth in such traditions, is to be guilty of violating
every principle of historic logic? Such was the
course pursued by our early chroniclers, but it is
not one that we can be justified in repeating. In
their view no doubt, the annals of the several Saxon
kingdoms did supply points of definite information;
but we are now able to take the measure of their
credulity, and to apply severer canons of criticism
to the facts themselves which they believed and recorded.
If it was the tendency and duty of their
age to deliver to us the history that they found, it
is the tendency and duty of ours to enquire upon
what foundation that history rests, and what amount
of authority it may justly claim.</p>

<p class='c001'>The little that Beda could collect at the beginning
of the eighth century, formed the basis of all
the subsequent reports. Though not entirely free
from the prejudices of his time, and yielding ready
faith to tales which his frame of mind disposed him
willingly to credit, he seems to have bestowed some
pains upon the investigation and critical appreciation
of the materials he collected. But the limits
of the object he had proposed to himself, viz. the
ecclesiastical history of the island, not only imposed
upon him the necessity of commencing his detailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>narrative at a comparatively late period<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c008'><sup>[48]</sup></a>, but led
him to reject much that may have been well known
to him, of our secular history. The deeds of pagan
and barbarous chieftains offered little to attract his
attention or command his sympathies; indeed were
little likely to be objects of interest to those from
whom his own information was generally derived.
Beda’s account, copied and recopied both at home
and abroad, was swelled by a few vague data from
the regnal annals of the kings; these were probably
increased by a few traditions, ill understood and ill
applied, which belonged exclusively to the epical
or mythological cycles of our own several tribes
and races, and the cognate families of the continent;
and finally the whole was elaborated into a mass of
inconsistent fables, on the admission of Cymric or
Armorican tales by Norman writers, who for the
most part felt as little interest in the fate of the
Briton as the Saxon, and were as little able to appreciate
the genuine history of the one as of the
other race. Thus Wóden, Bældæg, Geát, Scyld,
Sceáf and Beówa gradually found their way into
the royal genealogies; one by one, Brutus, Aurelius
Ambrosius, Uther Pendragon and Arthur, Hengest,
Hors and Vortigern, all became numbered
among historical personages; and from heroes of
respective epic poems sunk down into kings and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>warriors, who lived and fought and died upon the
soil of England.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are ignorant what <em>fasti</em> or mode even of
reckoning the revolutions of seasons prevailed in
England, previous to the introduction of Christianity.
We know not how any event before the
year 600 was recorded, or to what period the memory
of man extended. There may have been rare
annals: there may have been poems: if such there
were they have perished, and have left no trace
behind, unless we are to attribute to them such
scanty notices as the Saxon chronicle adds to Beda’s
account. From such sources however little could
have been gained of accurate information either as
to the real internal state, the domestic progress,
or development of a people. The dry, bare entries
of the chronicles in historical periods may
supply the means of judging what sort of annals
were likely to exist before the general introduction
of the Roman alphabet and parchment, while, in
all probability, runes supplied the place of letters,
and stones, or the <em>beech</em>-wood from which their name
is derived, of <em>books</em>. Again, the traditions embodied
in the epic, are preeminently those of kings
and princes: they are heroical, devoted to celebrate
the divine or half-divine founders of a race,
the fortunes of their warlike descendants, the manners
and mode of life of military adventurers, not
the obscure progress, household peace and orderly
habits of the humble husbandman. They are full
of feasts and fighting, shining arms and golden
goblets: the gods mingle among men almost their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>equals, share in the same pursuits, are animated by
the same passions of love, and jealousy and hatred;
or, blending the divine with the mortal nature, become
the founders of races, kingly because derived
from divinity itself. But one race knows little of
another or its traditions, and cares as little for them.
Alliances or wars alone bring them in contact with
one another; and the terms of intercourse between
the races will for the most part determine the character
under which foreign heroes shall be admitted
into the national epos, or whether they shall be
admitted at all. All history then, which is founded
in any degree upon epical tradition (and national
history is usually more or less so founded) must be
to that extent imperfect, if not inaccurate; only
when corrected by the written references of contemporaneous
authors, can we assign any certainty
to its records<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c008'><sup>[49]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us apply these observations to the early
events of Saxon history: of Kent indeed we have
the vague and uncertain notices which I have mentioned:
even more vague and uncertain are those
of Sussex and Wessex. Of the former, we learn
that in the year 477, Ælli, with three sons, Cymen,
Wlencing and Cissa, landed in Sussex; that in the
year 485 they defeated the Welsh, and that in 491
they destroyed the population of Anderida<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c008'><sup>[50]</sup></a>. Not
another word is there about Sussex, before the arrival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of Augustine, except a late assertion of the
military preeminence of Ælli among the Saxon
chieftains. The events of Wessex are somewhat
better detailed; we learn that in 495 two nobles,
Cerdic and Cyneríc, came to England, and landed
at Cerdices ora, where on the same day they fought
a battle: that in 501 they were followed by a noble
named Port, who with his two sons Bieda and
Mægla made a forcible landing at Portsmouth:
and that in 508 they gained a great battle over a
British king, whom they slew together with five
thousand of his people. In 514 Stuff and Wihtgár,
their nephews, brought them a reinforcement of
three ships; in 519 they again defeated the Britons,
and established the kingdom of Wessex. In 527 a
new victory is recorded: in 530, the Isle of Wight
was subdued and given to Wihtgár; and in 534,
Cerdic died, and was succeeded by Cyneríc, who
reigned twenty-six years<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c008'><sup>[51]</sup></a>. In 544 Wihtgár died.
A victory of Cyneríc in 552 and 556, and Ceawlin’s
accession to the throne of Wessex are next recorded.
Wars of the Westsaxon kings are noted in 568,
571, 577, 584. From 590 to 595 a king of that
race named Ceól is mentioned: in 591 we learn
the expulsion of Ceawlin from power: in 593 the
deaths of Ceawlin, Cwichelm and Crida are mentioned,
and in 597, the year of Augustine’s arrival,
we learn that Ceólwulf ascended the throne of
Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meagre as these details are, they far exceed what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>is related of Northumberland, Essex or Eastanglia.
In 547 we are told that Ida began to reign
in the first of these kingdoms; and that he was succeeded
in 560 by Ælli: that after a reign of <em>thirty</em>
years<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c008'><sup>[52]</sup></a>, he died in 588 and was succeeded by Æðelríc,
who again in 593 was succeeded by Æðelfrið.
This is all we learn of Northumbria; of Mercia,
Essex, Eastanglia, and the innumerable kingdoms
that must have been comprised under these general
appellations, we hear not a single word.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this be all that we can now recover of events,
a great number of which must have fallen within
the lives of those to whom Augustine preached,
what credit shall we give to the inconsistent accounts
of earlier actions? How shall we supply
the almost total want of information respecting the
first settlements? What explanation have we to
give of the alliance between Jutes, Angles and
Saxons which preceded the invasions of England?
What knowledge will these records supply of the
real number and quality of the chieftains, the language
and blood of the populations who gradually
spread themselves from the Atlantic to the Frith
of Forth; of the remains of Roman cultivation, or
the amount of British power with which they had
to contend? of the vicissitudes of good and evil fortune
which visited the independent principalities,
before they were swallowed up in the kingdoms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the heptarchy, or the extent of the influence which
they retained after that event? On all these several
points we are left entirely in the dark; and yet
these are facts which it most imports us to know,
if we would comprehend the growth of a society
which endured for at least seven hundred years in
England, and formed the foundation of that in
which we live.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lappenberg has devoted several pages of his
elaborate history<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c008'><sup>[53]</sup></a> to an investigation of the Kentish
legends, with a view to demonstrate their traditional,
that is unhistorical, character. He has
shown that the best authorities are inconsistent
with one another and with themselves, in assigning
the period of Hengest’s arrival in England. Carefully
comparing the dates of the leading events, as
given from the soundest sources, he has proved beyond
a doubt, that all these periods are calculated
upon a mythical number 8, whose multiples recur in
every year assigned. Thus the periods of twenty-four,
sixteen, eight and particularly forty years
meet us at every turn; and a somewhat similar
tendency may, I think, be observed in the earlier
dates of Westsaxon history cited in a preceding
page. It is also very probable that the early genealogies
of the various Anglosaxon kings were
arranged in series of eight names, including always
the great name of Wóden<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c008'><sup>[54]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result of all these enquiries is, to guard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>against plausible details which can only mislead
us. If we endeavour to destroy the credit of traditions
which have long existed, it is only to put
something in their place, inconsistent with them,
but of more value: to reduce them to what they
really are, lest their authority should render the
truth more obscure, and its pursuit more difficult
than is necessary; but to use them wherever they
seem capable of guiding our researches, and are
not irreconcilable with our other conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Far less in the fabulous records adopted by historians,
than in the divisions of the land itself,
according to the populations that occupied it, and
the rank of their several members, must the truth
be sought. The names of the tribes and families
have survived in the localities where they settled,
while their peculiar forms of customary law have
become as it were melted together into one general
system; and the national legends which each of
them most probably possessed, have either perished
altogether, or are now to be traced only in proper
names which fill up the genealogies of the royal
families<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c008'><sup>[55]</sup></a>. To these local names I shall return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hereafter; they will furnish a strong confirmation
of what has been advanced in this chapter as to
the probability of an early and wide dispersion
of Teutonic settlers in Britain.</p>

add that Zeuss, whose opinion on such a point is entitled to the highest

thus rendered not altogether improbable: but then it must be understood
of Saxons already established in England, and on the very line of

however, refutes him and places it between 395 and 407. Dec. cap.
xvii. I am inclined to think even this date inaccurate, and that the
Romans did not maintain any such great establishment in Britain, as that
herein described, at so late a period. For even Ammianus tells us in
364, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc tempore Picti, Saxonesque et Scotti et Attacotti Britannos
aerumnis vexavere continuis,</span>” (Hist. xxvi. 4), which is hardly consistent
with a flourishing state of the Roman civil and military rule. The
actual document we possess may possibly date from 390 or 400, but it
refers to the arrangements of an earlier time, and to an organization of
Roman power in more palmy days of their dominion.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. The document itself may be consulted in Graevius, vol. vii. The
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">littus Saxonicum per Britannias</span>” extended at least from the Portus
Adurni to Branodunum, that is, from the neighbourhood of Portsmouth
to Branchester on the Wash. In both these places there were civil or

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Professor Leo, of Halle, has called attention to a remarkable resemblance
between the names of certain places in Kent, and settlements
of the Alamanni upon the Neckar. A few of these, it must be admitted,
are striking, but the majority are only such as might be expected to
arise from similarities of surface and natural features in any two countries
settled by cognate populations, having nearly the same language,
religious rites and civil institutions. Even if the fact be admitted in
the fullest extent, it is still unnecessary to adopt Dr. Leo’s hypothesis,
that the coincidence is due to a double migration from the shores of
the Elbe. Rectitud. sing. person. pp. 100-104. It has been already
stated that Constantius was accompanied to Britain by an Alamannic
king; and I cannot doubt that under Valentinian, a force of Alamanni
served in this country. Ammianus says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valentinianus ... in Macriani
locum, Bucinobantibus, quae contra Moguntiacum gens est Alamanna,
regem Fraomarium ordinavit: quem paullo postea, quoniam
recens excursus eundem penitus vastaverat pagum, in Britannos translatum
potestate tribuni, Alamannorum praefecerat numero, multitudine,
viribusque ea tempestate florenti.</span>” Hist. xxix. c. 4. The context
renders it impossible that this “numerus Alamannorum” should have
been anything but genuine Germans.</p>

the shape in which he contended with Athene and mingled with

deny the obligation under which the reader of romance has been laid

the countrymen of Geoffry that we have also gained the marvellous
superstructure of imagination which has supplied the tales of that time,

papers read by the Rev. R. Garnett before the Philological Society in
1843, 1844, we learn that a considerable proportion of the words which
denote the daily processes of agriculture, domestic life, and generally
indoor and outdoor service, are borrowed by us from the Keltic.
Philolog. Trans, i. 171 <i>seq.</i> The amount of Keltic words yet current
in English may of course he accounted for in part, without the hypothesis
of an actual incorporation; but many have unquestionably been
borrowed, and serve to show that a strong Keltic element was permitted
to remain and influence the Saxon. That it did so especially in local
names is not of much importance, as it may be doubted whether conquest
ever succeeded in changing these entirely, in any country.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER II. <br /> THE MARK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All that we learn of the original principle of
settlement, prevalent either in England or on the
continent of Europe, among the nations of Germanic
blood, rests upon two main foundations;
first, the possession of land; second, the distinction
of rank; and the public law of every Teutonic tribe
implies the dependence of one upon the other
principle, to a greater or less extent. Even as he
who is not free can, at first, hold no land within the
limits of the community, so is he who holds no
land therein, not fully free, whatever his personal
rank or character may be. Thus far the Teutonic
settler differs but little from the ancient Spartiate
or the comrade of Romulus.</p>

<p class='c001'>The particular considerations which arise from the
contemplation of these principles in their progressive
development, will find their place in the several
chapters of this Book: it deals with land held
in community, and severalty; with the nature and
accidents of tenure; with the distinction and privileges
of the various classes of citizens, the free, the
noble and the serf; and with the institutions by
which a mutual guarantee of life, honour and peaceful
possession was attempted to be secured among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the Anglosaxons. These are the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>incunabula</i></span>, first
principles and rudiments of the English law<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c008'><sup>[56]</sup></a>; and
in these it approaches, and assimilates to, the system
which the German conquerors introduced into
every state which they founded upon the ruins of
the Roman power.</p>

<p class='c001'>As land may be held by many men in common,
or by several households, under settled conditions
it is expedient to examine separately the nature
and character of these tenures: and first to enquire
into the forms of possession in common; for upon
this depends the political being of the state, its
constitutional law, and its relative position towards
other states. Among the Anglosaxons land so held
in common was designated by the names Mark, and
Gâ or Shire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The smallest and simplest of these common divisions
is that which we technically call a Mark or
March (mearc); a word less frequent in the Anglosaxon
than the German muniments, only because
the system founded upon what it represents yielded
in England earlier than in Germany to extraneous
influences. This is the first general division, the
next in order to the private estates or alods of the
Markmen: as its name denotes, it is something
marked out or defined, having settled boundaries;
something serving as a sign to others, and distinguished
by signs. It is the plot of land on which
a greater or lesser number of free men have settled
for purposes of cultivation, and for the sake
of mutual profit and protection; and it comprises a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>portion both of arable land and pasture, in proportion
to the numbers that enjoy its produce<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c008'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>However far we may pursue our researches into
the early records of our forefathers, we cannot discover
a period at which this organization was
unknown. Whatever may have been the original
condition of the German tribes, tradition and history
alike represent them to us as living partly by
agriculture, partly by the pasturing of cattle<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c008'><sup>[58]</sup></a>. They
had long emerged from the state of wandering
herdsmen, hunters or fishers, when they first attracted
the notice, and disputed or repelled the
power, of Rome. The peculiar tendencies of various
tribes may have introduced peculiar modes of
placing or constructing their habitations; but of
no German population is it stated, that they dwelt
in tents like the Arab, in waggons like the Scythian,
or in earth-dug caverns like the troglodytes
of Wallachia: the same authority that tells of some
who lived alone as the hill-side or the fresh spring
pleased them<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c008'><sup>[59]</sup></a>, notices the villages, the houses and
even the fortresses, of others.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Without commerce, means of extended communication,
or peaceful neighbours, the Germans cannot
have cultivated their fields for the service of
strangers: they must have been consumers, as they
certainly were raisers, of bread-corn; early documents
of the Anglosaxons prove that considerable
quantities of wheat were devoted to this purpose.
Even the serfs and domestic servants were entitled
to an allowance of bread, in addition to the supply
of flesh<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c008'><sup>[60]</sup></a>; and the large quantities of ale and beer
which we find enumerated among the dues payable
from the land, or in gifts to religious establishments,
presume a very copious supply of cereals
for the purpose of malting<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c008'><sup>[61]</sup></a>. But it is also certain
that our forefathers depended very materially for
subsistence upon the herds of oxen, sheep, and
especially swine, which they could feed upon the
unenclosed meadows, or in the wealds of oak and
beech which covered a large proportion of the land.
From the moment, in short, when we first learn
anything of their domestic condition, all the German
tribes appear to be settled upon arable land,
surrounded with forest pastures, and having some
kind of property in both.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Caesar, it is true, denies that agriculture was
much cultivated among the Germans, or that property
in the arable land was permitted to be permanent<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c008'><sup>[62]</sup></a>:
and, although it seems impolitic to limit the
efforts of industry, by diminishing its reward, it is
yet conceivable that, under peculiar circumstances,
a warlike confederation might overlook this obvious
truth in their dread of the enervating influences
of property and a settled life. There may have
been difficulty in making a new yearly division of
land, which to our prejudices seems almost impossible;
yet the Arab of Oran claims only the produce
of the seed he has sown<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c008'><sup>[63]</sup></a>; the proprietor in the
Jaghire district of Madras changes his lands from
year to year<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c008'><sup>[64]</sup></a>: the tribes of the Afghans submit to
a new distribution even after a ten years’ possession
has endeared the field to the cultivator<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c008'><sup>[65]</sup></a>; Diodorus
tells us that the Vaccaeans changed their lands
yearly and divided the produce<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c008'><sup>[66]</sup></a>; and Strabo attributed
a similar custom to one tribe at least of the
Illyrian Dalmatians, after a period of seven<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c008'><sup>[67]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But so deeply does the possession of land enter
into the principle of all the Teutonic institutions,
that I cannot bring myself to believe in the accuracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of Caesar’s statement. Like his previous rash
and most unfounded assertion respecting the German
gods, this may rest only upon the incorrect
information of Gallic provincials: at the utmost it
can be applied only to the Suevi and their warlike
allies<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c008'><sup>[68]</sup></a>, if it be not even intended to be confined to
the predatory bands of Ariovistus, encamped among
the defeated yet hostile Sequani<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c008'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. The equally
well-known passage of Tacitus,—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arva per annos
mutant, et superest ager<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c008'><sup>[70]</sup></a>,</span>”—may be most safely
rendered as applying to the common mode of culture;
“they change the arable from year to year,
and there is land to spare;” that is, for commons
and pasture: but it does not amount to a proof
that settled property in land was not a part of the
Teutonic scheme; it implies no more than this,
that within the Mark which was the property of all,
what was this year one man’s corn-land, might the
next be another man’s fallow; a process very intelligible
to those who know anything of the system
of cultivation yet prevalent in parts of Germany,
or have ever had any interest in what we call Lammas
Meadows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Zeuss, whose admirable work<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c008'><sup>[71]</sup></a> is indispensable
to the student of Teutonic antiquity, brings together
various passages to show that at some early
period, the account given by Caesar may have
conveyed a just description of the mode of life in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Germany<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c008'><sup>[72]</sup></a>. He represents its inhabitants to himself
as something between a settled and an unsettled
people. What they may have been in periods previous
to the dawn of authentic history, it is impossible
to say; but all that we really know of them
not only implies a much more advanced state of
civilization, but the long continuance and tradition
of such a state. We cannot admit the validity of
Zeuss’ reasoning, or escape from the conviction
that it mainly results from a desire to establish his
etymology of the names borne by the several confederations,
and which requires the hypothesis of
wandering and unsettled tribes<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c008'><sup>[73]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The word Mark has a legal as well as a territorial
meaning: it is not only a space of land, such
as has been described, but a member of a state
also; in which last sense it represents those who
dwell upon the land, in relation to their privileges
and rights, both as respects themselves and others.
But the word, as applied even to the territory, has
a twofold meaning: it is, properly speaking, employed
to denote not only the whole district occupied
by one small community<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c008'><sup>[74]</sup></a>; but more especially
those forests and wastes by which the arable is enclosed,
and which separate the possessions of one
tribe from those of another<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c008'><sup>[75]</sup></a>. The Mark or boundary
pasture-land, and the cultivated space which
it surrounds, and which is portioned out to the several
members of the community, are inseparable;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>however different the nature of the property which
can be had in them, they are in fact one whole;
taken together, they make up the whole territorial
possession of the original <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cognatio</i></span>, kin or tribe.
The ploughed lands and meadows are guarded by
the Mark; and the cultivator ekes out a subsistence
which could hardly be wrung from the small plot
he calls his own, by the flesh and other produce of
beasts, which his sons, his dependents or his serfs
mast for him in the outlying forests.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us first take into consideration the Mark in
its restricted and proper sense of a boundary. Its
most general characteristic is, that it should not be
distributed in arable, but remain in heath, forest,
fen and pasture. In it the Markmen—called in
Germany Markgenossen, and perhaps by the Anglosaxons
Mearcgeneátas—had commonable rights;
but there could be no private estate in it, no híd or
hlot, no κλῆρος, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>haeredium</i></span>. Even if under peculiar
circumstances, any markman obtained a right
to essart or clear a portion of the forest, the portion
so subjected to the immediate law of property
ceased to be mark. It was undoubtedly under
the protection of the gods; and it is probable that
within its woods were those sacred shades especially
consecrated to the habitation and service of
the deity<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c008'><sup>[76]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>If the nature of an early Teutonic settlement,
which has nothing in common with a city, be duly
considered, there will appear an obvious necessity
for the existence of a mark, and for its being maintained
inviolate. Every community, not sheltered
by walls, or the still firmer defences of public law,
must have one, to separate it from neighbours and
protect it from rivals: it is like the outer pulp that
surrounds and defends the kernel. No matter how
small or how large the community,—it may be
only a village, even a single household, or a whole
state,—it will still have a Mark, a space or boundary
by which its own rights of jurisdiction are
limited, and the encroachments of others are kept
off<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c008'><sup>[77]</sup></a>. The more extensive the community which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>is interested in the Mark, the more solemn and
sacred the formalities by which it is consecrated
and defended; but even the boundary of the private
man’s estate is under the protection of the
gods and of the law. “Accursed,” in all ages
and all legislations, “is he that removeth his
neighbour’s landmark.” Even the owner of a private
estate is not allowed to build or cultivate to
the extremity of his own possession, but must leave
a space for eaves<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c008'><sup>[78]</sup></a>. Nor is the general rule abrogated
by changes in the original compass of the
communities; as smaller districts coalesce and become,
as it were, compressed into one body, the
smaller and original Marks may become obliterated
and converted merely into commons, but the public
mark will have been increased upon the new and
extended frontier. Villages tenanted by Heardingas
or Módingas may cease to be separated, but the
larger divisions which have grown up by their union,
Meanwaras, Mægsetan or Hwiccas<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c008'><sup>[79]</sup></a> will still have
a boundary of their own; these again may be lost
in the extending circuit of Wessex or Mercia; till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a yet greater obliteration of the Marks having been
produced through increasing population, internal
conquest, or the ravages of foreign invaders, the
great kingdom of England at length arises, having
wood and desolate moorland and mountain as its
mark against Scots, Cumbrians and Britons, and
the eternal sea itself as a bulwark against Frankish
and Frisian pirates<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c008'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But although the Mark is waste, it is yet the
property of the community: it belongs to the freemen
as a whole, not as a partible possession: it
may as little be profaned by the stranger, as the
arable land itself which it defends<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c008'><sup>[81]</sup></a>. It is under the
safeguard of the public law, long after it has ceased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>to be under the immediate protection of the gods:
it is unsafe, full of danger; death lurks in its shades
and awaits the incautious or hostile visitant:</p>

<p class='c018'>punishments of the most frightful character are denounced
against him who violates it<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c008'><sup>[83]</sup></a>; and though,
in historical times, these can only be looked upon
as comminatory and symbolical, it is very possible
that they may be the records of savage sacrifices
believed due, and even offered, to the gods of the
violated sanctuary. I can well believe that we too
had once our Diana Taurica. The Marks are called
accursed; that is accursed to man, accursed to him
that does not respect their sanctity: but they are
sacred, for on their maintenance depend the safety
of the community, and the service of the deities
whom that community honours<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c008'><sup>[84]</sup></a>. And even when
the gods have abdicated their ancient power, even
to the very last, the terrors of superstition come in
aid of the enactments of law: the deep forests and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>marshes are the abodes of monsters and dragons;
wood-spirits bewilder and decoy the wanderer to
destruction: the Nicors house by the side of lakes
and marshes<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c008'><sup>[85]</sup></a>: Grendel, the man-eater, is a “mighty
stepper over the mark<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c008'><sup>[86]</sup></a>”: the chosen home of the
firedrake is a fen<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c008'><sup>[87]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The natural tendency, however, of this state of
isolation is to give way; population is an ever-active
element of social well-being: and when once
the surface of a country has become thickly studded
with communities settled between the Marks,
and daily finding the several clearings grow less
and less sufficient for their support<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c008'><sup>[88]</sup></a>, the next step
is the destruction of the Marks themselves, and the
union of the settlers in larger bodies, and under
altered circumstances. Take two villages, placed
on such clearings in the bosom of the forest, each
having an ill-defined boundary in the wood that
separates them, each extending its circuit woodward
as population increases and presses upon the
land, and each attempting to drive its Mark further
into the waste, as the arable gradually encroaches
upon this. On the first meeting of the herdsmen,
one of three courses appears unavoidable: the communities
must enter into a federal union; one must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>attack and subjugate the other; or the two must
coalesce into one on friendly and equal terms<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c008'><sup>[89]</sup></a>.
The last-named result is not improbable, if the gods
of the one tribe are common to the other: then
perhaps the temples only may shift their places a
little. But in any case the intervening forest will
cease to be Mark, because it will now lie in the
centre, and not on the borders of the new community.
It will be converted into common pasture,
to be enjoyed by all on fixed conditions; or it may
even be gradually rooted out, ploughed, planted
and rendered subject to the ordinary accidents of
arable land: it will become <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>folcland</i></span>, public land,
applicable to the general uses of the enlarged state,
nay even divisible into private estates, upon the
established principles of public law. And this process
will be repeated and continue until the family
becomes a tribe, and the tribe a kingdom; when
the intervening boundary lands, cleared, drained
and divided, will have been clothed with golden
harvests, or portioned out in meadows and common
pastures, appurtenant to villages; and the
only marks remaining will be the barren mountain
and moor of the frontiers, the deep unforded rivers,
and the great ocean that washes the shores of the
continent.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Christianity, which destroys or diminishes the
holiness of the forests, necessarily confines the guarantee
of the Mark to the public law of the state.
Hence when these districts become included within
the limits of Christian communities, there is no
difficulty in the process which has been described:
the state deals with them as with any other part of
its territory, by its own sovereign power, according
to the prevalent ideas of agricultural or political
œconomy; and the once inviolate land may at once
be converted to public uses, widely different from
its original destination, if the public advantage require
it. No longer necessary as a boundary, from
the moment when the smaller community has become
swallowed up and confounded in the larger,
it may remain in commons, be taken possession of
by the state as folcland, or become the source of
even private estates, and to all these purposes we
find it gradually applied. In process of time it
seems even to have become partible and appurtenant
to private estates in a certain proportion to
the arable<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c008'><sup>[90]</sup></a>: towards the close of the tenth century
I find the grant of a mill and millstead, “and thereto
as much of the markland as belongeth to three
hydes”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c008'><sup>[91]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The general advantage which requires the maintenance
of the Mark as public property, does not
however preclude the possibility of using it for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>public purposes, as long as the great condition of
indivisibility is observed. Although it may not be
cleared and ploughed, it may be depastured, and
all the herds of the Markmen may be fed and
masted upon its wilds and within its shades. While
it still comprises only a belt of forest, lying between
small settlements, those who live contiguous to it,
are most exposed to the sudden incursions of an
enemy, and perhaps specially entrusted with the
measures for public defence, may have peculiar
privileges, extending in certain cases even to the
right of clearing or essarting portions of it. In
the case of the wide tracts which separate kingdoms,
we know that a comprehensive military organization
prevailed, with castles, garrisons, and
governors or Margraves, as in Austria, Brandenburg
and Baden, Spoleto and Ancona, Northumberland
and the Marches of Wales. But where
clearings have been made in the forest, the holders
are bound to see that they are maintained, and that
the fresh arable land be not encroached upon; if
forest-trees spring there by neglect of the occupant,
the essart again becomes forest, and, as such,
subject to all the common rights of the Markmen,
whether in pasture, chase or estovers<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c008'><sup>[92]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sanctity of the Mark is the condition and
guarantee of its indivisibility, without which it cannot
long be proof against the avarice or ambition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of individuals: and its indivisibility is, in turn, the
condition of the service which it is to render as a
bulwark, and of its utility as a pasture. I therefore
hold it certain that some solemn religious ceremonies
at first accompanied and consecrated its limitation<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c008'><sup>[93]</sup></a>.
What these may have consisted in, among
the heathen Anglosaxons, we cannot now discover,
but many circumstances render it probable that
Wóden, who in this function also resembles Ἑρμῆς,
was the tutelary god<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c008'><sup>[94]</sup></a>: though not absolutely to the
exclusion of other deities, Tiw and Frea appearing
to have some claim to a similar distinction<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c008'><sup>[95]</sup></a>. But
however its limit was originally drawn or driven, it
was, as its name denotes, distinguished by marks
or signs. Trees of peculiar size and beauty, and
carved with the figures of birds and beasts, perhaps
even with Runic characters, served the purpose of
limitation and definition<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c008'><sup>[96]</sup></a>: striking natural features,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>a hill, a brook, a morass, a rock, or the artificial
mound of an ancient warrior, warned the intruder
to abstain from dangerous ground, or taught the
herdsman how far he might advance with impunity.
In water or in marshy land, poles were set
up, which it was as impious to remove, as it would
have been to cut or burn down a mark-tree in the
forest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the second and more important sense of the
word, the Mark is a community of families or
households, settled on such plots of land and forest
as have been described. This is the original basis
upon which all Teutonic society rests, and must be
assumed to have been at first amply competent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>all the demands of society in a simple and early
stage of development: for example, to have been
a union for the purpose of administering justice,
or supplying a mutual guarantee of peace, security
and freedom for the inhabitants of the district. In
this organization, the use of the land, the woods
and the waters was made dependent upon the general
will of the settlers, and could only be enjoyed
under general regulations made by all for the benefit
of all. The Mark was a voluntary association
of free men, who laid down for themselves, and
strictly maintained, a system of cultivation by
which the produce of the land on which they settled
might be fairly and equally secured for their
service and support; and from participation in
which they jealously excluded all who were not
born, or adopted, into the association. Circumstances
dependent upon the peculiar local conformation
of the district, or even on the relations of
the original parties to the contract, may have caused
a great variety in the customs of different Marks;
and these appear occasionally anomalous, when we
meet with them still subsisting in a different order
of social existence<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c008'><sup>[97]</sup></a>; but with the custom of one
Mark, another had nothing to do, and the Markmen,
within their own limit, were independent,
sufficient to their own support and defence, and
seised of full power and authority to regulate their
own affairs, as seemed most conducive to their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>advantage. The Court of the Markmen, as it may
be justly called, must have had supreme jurisdiction,
at first, over all the causes which could in any
way affect the interests of the whole body or the
individuals composing it: and suit and service to
such court was not less the duty, than the high
privilege, of the free settlers. On the continent of
Germany the divisions of the Marks and the extent
of their jurisdiction can be ascertained with considerable
precision; from these it maybe inferred
that in very many cases the later courts of the
great landowners had been in fact at first Markcourts,
in which, even long after the downfall of
the primæval freedom, the Lord, himself had been
only the first Markman, the patron or defender of
the simple freemen, either by inheritance or their
election<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c008'><sup>[98]</sup></a>. In this country, the want of materials
precludes the attainment of similar certainty, but
there can be no reason to doubt that the same process
took place, and that originally Markcourts
existed among ourselves with the same objects and
powers. In a charter of the year 971, Cod. Dipl.
No. 568, we find the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mearcmót</i></span>, which can
there mean only the place where such a court, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mót</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>or meeting was held: while the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mearcbeorh</i></span>, which
is not at all of rare occurrence, appears to denote
the hill or mound which was the site of the court,
and the place where the free settlers met at stated
periods to do right between man and man<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c008'><sup>[99]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not at all necessary that these communities
should have been very small; on the contrary, some
of the Marks were probably of considerable extent,
and capable of bringing a respectable force into
the field upon emergency: others, no doubt, were
less populous, and extensive: but a hundred heads
of houses, which is not at all an extravagant supposition,
protected by trackless forests, in a district
not well known to the invader, constitute a body
very well able to defend its rights and privileges.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although the Mark seems originally to have been
defined by the nature of the district, the hills,
streams and forests, still its individual, peculiar
and, as it were, private character depended in some
degree also upon long-subsisting relations of the
Markmen, both among themselves, and with regard
to others. I represent them to myself as great family
unions, comprising households of various degrees
of wealth, rank and authority: some, in direct
descent from the common ancestors, or from the
hero of the particular tribe: others, more distantly
connected, through the natural result of increasing
population, which multiplies indeed the members of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the family, but removes them at every step further
from the original stock: some, admitted into communion
by marriage, others by adoption; others
even by emancipation; but all recognizing a brotherhood,
a kinsmanship or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sibsceaft</i></span><a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c008'><sup>[100]</sup></a>; all standing
together as one unit in respect of other, similar
communities; all governed by the same judges and
led by the same captains; all sharing in the same
religious rites, and all known to themselves and
to their neighbours by one general name.</p>

<p class='c001'>The original significance of these names is now
perhaps matter of curious, rather than of useful
enquiry. Could we securely determine it, we should,
beyond doubt, obtain an insight into the antiquities
of the Germanic races, far transcending the actual
extent of our historical knowledge; this it is hopeless
now to expect: ages of continual struggles, of
violent convulsions, of conquests and revolutions,
lie between us and our forefathers: the traces of
their steps have been effaced by the inexorable
march of a different civilization. This alone is certain,
that the distinction must have lain deeply
rooted in the national religion, and supplied abundant
materials for the national epos. Much has
been irrecoverably lost, yet in what remains we
recognize fragments which bear the impress of former
wealth and grandeur. Beówulf, the Traveller’s
Song, and the multifarious poems and traditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of Scandinavia, not less than the scattered names
which meet us here and there in early German
history, offer hints which can only serve to excite
regret for the mass which has perished. The kingdoms
and empires which have exercised the profoundest
influence upon the course of modern civilization,
have sprung out of obscure communities
whose very names are only known to us through
the traditions of the poet, or the local denominations
which record the sites of their early settlements.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many hypotheses may be formed to account for
these ancient aggregations, especially on the continent
of Europe. Perhaps not the least plausible
is that of a single family, itself claiming descent,
through some hero, from the gods, and gathering
other scattered families around itself; thus retaining
the administration of the family rites of religion,
and giving its own name to all the rest of the
community. Once established, such distinctive appellations
must wander with the migrations of the
communities themselves, or such portions of them
as want of land and means, and excess of population
at home, compelled to seek new settlements.
In the midst of restless movements, so general
and extensive as those of our progenitors, it cannot
surprise us, when we find the gentile names
of Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, reproduced
upon our own shores. Even where a
few adventurers—one only—bearing a celebrated
name, took possession of a new home, comrades
would readily be found, glad to constitute themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>around him under an appellation long recognized as
heroic: or a leader, distinguished for his skill, his
valour and success, his power or superior wealth,
may have found little difficulty in imposing the
name of his own race upon all who shared in his
adventures. Thus Harlings and Wælsings, names
most intimately connected with the great epos of
the Germanic and Scandinavian races, are reproduced
in several localities in England: Billing, the
noble progenitor of the royal race of Saxony, has
more than one enduring record: and similarly, I
believe all the local denominations of the early
settlements to have arisen and been perpetuated<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c008'><sup>[101]</sup></a>.
So much light appears derivable from a proper investigation
of these names, that I have collected
them in an Appendix (<a href='#app_A'>A</a>.) at the end of this volume,
to the contents of which the reader’s attention
is invited<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c008'><sup>[102]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>In looking over this list we are immediately
struck with a remarkable repetition of various
names, some of which are found at once in several
counties; and most striking are those which, like the
examples already alluded to, give a habitation upon
our own shores to the races celebrated in the poetical
or historical records of other ages and other lands.
There are indeed hardly any enquiries of deeper
interest, than those whose tendency is to link the
present with the past in the bonds of a mythical
tradition; or which presents results of greater importance
to him who has studied the modes of
thought and action of populations at an early stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of their career. The intimate relations of mythology,
law and social institutions, which later ages
are too apt scornfully to despise, or superstitiously
to imitate, are for them, living springs of action:
they are believed in, not played with, as in the
majority of <em>revivals</em>, from the days of Anytus and
Melitus to our own; and they form the broad foundation
upon which the whole social polity is established.
The people who believe in heroes, originally
gods and always god-born, preserve a remembrance
of their ancient deities in the gentile names
by which themselves are distinguished, long after
the rites they once paid to their divinities have
fallen into disuse; and it is this record of beings
once hallowed, and a cult once offered, which they
have bequeathed to us in many of the now unintelligible
names of the Marks. Taking these facts
into account, I have no hesitation in affirming
that the names of places found in the Anglosaxon
charters, and yet extant in England, supply no
trifling links in the chain of evidence by which we
demonstrate the existence among ourselves of a
heathendom nearly allied to that of Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Wælsings, the Völsungar of the Edda, and
Volsungen of the German Heldensage, have already
been noticed in a cursory manner: they are
the family whose hero is Siegfried or Sigurdr<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c008'><sup>[103]</sup></a>, the
centre round which the Nibelungen epos circles.
Another of their princes, Fitela, the Norse Sinfiötli,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>is recorded in the poem of Beówulf<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c008'><sup>[104]</sup></a>, and from him
appear to have been derived the Fitelingas, whose
name survives in Fitling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Herelingas or Harlings have also been noticed;
they are connected with the same great
cycle, and are mentioned in the Traveller’s Song,
l. 224. As Harlingen in Friesland retains a record
of the same name, it is possible that it may have
wandered to the coast of Norfolk with the Batavian
auxiliaries, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>numerus Batavorum</i></span>, who served
under their own chiefs in Britain. The Swǽfas,
a border tribe of the Angles<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c008'><sup>[105]</sup></a>, reappear at Swaffham.
The Brentings<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c008'><sup>[106]</sup></a> are found again in Brentingby.
The Scyldings and Scylfings<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c008'><sup>[107]</sup></a>, perhaps the most
celebrated of the Northern races, give their names
to Skelding and Shilvington. The Ardings, whose
memorial is retained in Ardingley, Ardington and
Ardingworth, are the Azdingi<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c008'><sup>[108]</sup></a>, the royal race of
the Visigoths and Vandals: a name which confirms
the tradition of a settlement of Vandals in England.
With these we probably should not confound the
Heardingas, who have left their name to Hardingham
in Norfolk<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c008'><sup>[109]</sup></a>. The Banings, over whom Becca ruled<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c008'><sup>[110]</sup></a>,
are recognized in Banningham; the Hælsings<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c008'><sup>[111]</sup></a> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Helsington, and in the Swedish Helsingland<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c008'><sup>[112]</sup></a>: the
Myrgings<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c008'><sup>[113]</sup></a>, perhaps in Merring, and Merrington:
the Hundings<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c008'><sup>[114]</sup></a>, perhaps in Hunningham and Hunnington:
the Hócings<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c008'><sup>[115]</sup></a>, in Hucking: the Seringas<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c008'><sup>[116]</sup></a>
meet us again in Sharington, Sherington and Sheringham.
The Ðyringas<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c008'><sup>[117]</sup></a>, in Thorington and Thorrington,
are likely to be offshoots of the great Hermunduric
race, the Thyringi or Thoringi, now Thuringians,
always neighbours of the Saxons. The
Bleccingas, a race who probably gave name to
Bleckingen in Sweden, are found in Bletchington,
and Bletchingley. In the Gytingas, known to us
from Guiting, we can yet trace the Alamannic tribe
of the Juthungi, or Jutungi. Perhaps in the Scytingas
or Scydingas, we may find another Alamannic
tribe, the Scudingi<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c008'><sup>[118]</sup></a>, and in the Dylingas, an
Alpine or Highdutch name, the Tulingi<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c008'><sup>[119]</sup></a>. The
Wæringas are probably the Norman Vǽringjar,
whom we call Varangians. The Wylfingas<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c008'><sup>[120]</sup></a>, another
celebrated race, well known in Norse tradition, are
recorded in Beówulf<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c008'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and the Traveller’s Song<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c008'><sup>[122]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are unquestionably no trivial coincidences;
they assure us that there lies at the root of our land-divisions
an element of the highest antiquity; one
too, by which our kinsmanship with the North-german
races is placed beyond dispute. But their
analogy leads us to a wider induction: when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>examine the list of names contained in the <a href='#app_A'>Appendix</a>,
we see at once how very few of these are identified
with the names recorded in Beówulf and other
poems: all that are so recorded, had probably belonged
to portions of the epic cycle; but there is
nothing in the names themselves to distinguish them
from the rest; nothing at least but the happy accident
of those poems, which were dedicated to their
praise, having survived. In the lapse of years, how
many similar records may have perished! And may
we not justly conclude that a far greater number
of races might have been identified, had the Ages
spared the songs in which they were sung?</p>

<p class='c021'>Whatever periods we assume for the division of
the land into Marks, or to what cause soever we
attribute the names adopted by the several communities,
the method and manner of their dispersion
remains a question of some interest. The <a href='#app_A'>Appendix</a>
shows a most surprising distribution of some
particular names over several counties<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c008'><sup>[123]</sup></a>: but this
seems conceivable only in two ways; first, that the
inhabitants of a Mark, finding themselves pressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>for room at home, migrated to other seats, and
established a new community under the old designation;
or, secondly, that in the division of the
newly conquered soil, men who had belonged to one
community upon the continent, found themselves
thrown into a state of separation here, either by the
caprice of the lots, supposing their immigration
simultaneous, or by the natural course of events,
supposing one body to have preceded the other.
Perhaps too we must admit the possibility of a
dispersion arising from the dissolution of ancient
confederacies, produced by internal war. On the
whole I am disposed to look upon the second hypothesis
as applicable to the majority of cases;
without presuming altogether to exclude the action
of the first and third causes. It is no doubt difficult
to imagine that a small troop of wandering
strangers should be allowed to traverse a settled
country in search of new habitations. Yet, at first,
there must have been abundance of land, which
conduct and courage might wring from its Keltic
owners. Again, how natural on the other hand is
it, that in the confusion of conquest, or the dilatory
course of gradual occupation, men once united
should find their lot cast apart, and themselves
divided into distant communities! Nor in this can
we recognize anything resembling the solemn planting
of a Grecian, far less of a Roman, colony; or
suppose that any notion of a common origin survived
to nourish feelings of friendship between bodies
of men, so established in different lands. Even
had such traditions originally prevailed, they must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>soon have perished, when the Marks coalesced into
the Gá or Shire, and several of the latter became
included in one kingdom. New interests and
duties must then have readily superseded maxims
which belonged to an almost obsolete organization.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in truth, to this question of dispersion and
relationship, considered in its widest generality,
there is no limit either of place or time: it derives,
indeed, some of its charm from the very vagueness
which seems to defy the efforts of the historian:
and even the conviction that a positive and scientific
result is unattainable, does not suffice to repress
the anxiety with which we strive to lift the
veil of our Isis. The question of every settlement,
large or small, ultimately resolves itself into that of
the original migrations of mankind. Unless we
can bring ourselves to adopt the hypothesis of
autochthonous populations,—an hypothesis whose
vagueness is not less than attaches to a system of
gradual, but untraced, advances,—we must fall
back from point to point, until we reach one starting-place
and one origin. Every family that squats
upon the waste, assumes the existence of two families
from which it sprang: every household, comprising
a man and woman, if it is to be fruitful and
continue, presupposes two such households; each
of these continues to represent two more, in a geometrical
progression, whose enormous sum and final
result are lost in the night of ages. The solitary
who wanders away into the uncultivated waste, and
there by degrees rears a family, a tribe and a state,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>takes with him the traditions, the dispositions, the
knowledge and the ideas, which he had derived
from others, in turn equally indebted to their predecessors.
This state of society, if society it can
be called, is rarely exhibited to our observation.
The backwoodsman in America, or the settler in an
Australian bush, may furnish some means of judging
such a form of civilization; and the traditions
of Norway and Iceland dimly record a similar process:
but the solitary labourer, whose constant
warfare with an exulting and exuberant nature does
little more than assure him an independent existence,
has no time to describe the course and the
result of his toils: and the progress of the modern
settler is recorded less by himself, than by a civilized
society, whose offset he is; which watches
his fortunes with interest and judges them with intelligence;
which finds in his career the solution of
problems that distract itself, and never forgets that
he yet shares in the cultivation he has left behind
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still the manner in which such solitary households
gradually spread over and occupy a country,
must be nearly the same in all places, where they
exist at all. The family increases in number; the
arable is extended to provide food; the pasture
is pushed further and further as the cattle multiply,
or as the grasslands become less productive.
Along the banks of the river which may have attracted
the feelings or the avarice of the wanderer,
which may have guided his steps in the untracked
wilderness, or supplied the road by which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>journeyed, the footsteps of civilization move upward:
till, reaching the rising ground from which
the streams descend on either side, the vanguards
of two parties meet, and the watershed becomes
their boundary, and the place of meeting for religious
or political purposes. Meantime, the ford, the
mill, the bridge have become the nucleus of a village,
and the blessings of mutual intercourse and
family bonds have converted the squatters’ settlement
into a centre of wealth and happiness. And
in like manner is it, where a clearing in the forest,
near a spring or well<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c008'><sup>[124]</sup></a>,—divine, for its uses to man,—has
been made; and where, by slow degrees, the
separated families discover each other, and find
that it is not good for man to be alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>This description, however, will not strictly apply
to numerous or extensive cases of settlement, although
some analogy may be found, if we substitute
a tribe for the family. Continental Germany
has no tradition of such a process; and we may
not unjustly believe the records of such in Scandinavia
to have arisen from the wanderings of unquiet
spirits, impatient of control or rivalry, of criminals
shrinking from the consequences of their
guilt, or of descendants dreading the blood-feud
inherited from ruder progenitors. But although
systematic and religious colonization, like that of
Greece, cannot be assumed to have prevailed, we
may safely assert that it was carried on far more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>regularly, and upon more strict principles than are
compatible with capricious and individual settlement<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c008'><sup>[125]</sup></a>.
Tradition here and there throws light
upon the causes by which bodies of men were impelled
to leave their ancient habitations, and seek
new seats in more fruitful or peaceful districts.
The emigration represented by Hengest has been
attributed to a famine at home, and even the grave
authority of history has countenanced the belief
that his keels were driven into exile: thus far we
may assume his adventure to have been made with
the participation, if not by the authority, of the
parent state.</p>

<p class='c001'>In general we may admit the division of a conquered
country, such as Britain was, to have been
conducted upon settled principles, derived from the
actual position of the conquerors. As an army
they had obtained possession, and as an army they
distributed the booty which rewarded their valour.
That they nevertheless continued to occupy the
land as families or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cognationes</i></span>, resulted from the
method of their enrolment in the field itself, where
each kindred was drawn up under an officer of
its own lineage and appointment, and the several
members of the family served together. But such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>distribution of the land as should content the various
small communities that made up the whole force,
could only be ensured by the joint authority of the
leaders, the concurrence of the families themselves,
and the possession of a sufficient space for their
extension, undisturbed by the claims of former occupants,
and suited to the wants of its new masters.
What difficulties, what jealousies preceded the adjustment
of all claims among the conquerors, we
cannot hope to learn, or by what means these were
met and reconciled: but the divisions themselves,
so many of whose names I have collected, prove
that, in some way or other, the problem was successfully
solved.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the natural clearings in the forest, or on
spots prepared by man for his own uses; in valleys,
bounded by gentle acclivities which poured down
fertilizing streams; or on plains which here and
there rose, clothed with verdure, above surrounding
marshes; slowly and step by step, the warlike
colonists adopted the habits and developed the character
of peaceful agriculturists. The towns which
had been spared in the first rush of war, gradually
became deserted, and slowly crumbled to the soil,
beneath which their ruins are yet found from time
to time, or upon which shapeless masses yet remain,
to mark the sites of a civilization, whose bases were
not laid deep enough for eternity. All over England
there soon existed a network of communities,
the principle of whose being was separation, as regarded
each other: the most intimate union, as respected
the individual members of each. Agricultural,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>not commercial, dispersed, not centralized,
content within their own limits and little given to
wandering, they relinquished in a great degree the
habits and feelings which had united them as military
adventurers; and the spirit which had achieved
the conquest of an empire, was now satisfied with
the care of maintaining inviolate a little peaceful
plot, sufficient for the cultivation of a few simple
households.</p>

Bell. Gall. iv. 1, which still applies only to the Suevi. His next evidence
is the assertion of Tacitus just noticed. His third is from Plutarch’s
Aemil. Paul. c. 12, of the Bastarnae: ἄνδρες οὐ γεωργεῖν εἰδότες,
οὐ πλεῖν, οὐκ ἀπὸ ποιμνίων ζῆν νέμοντες, ἀλλ’ ἓν ἕργον καὶ μίαν τέχνην μελετῶντες,
ἁεὶ μάχεσθαι καὶ κρατεῖν τῶν ἀντιταττομένων. A people without
agriculture or commerce, and who live only on fighting, may be
left undisturbed in the realm of dreams with which philosophers are
conversant. Zeuss proceeds to reason upon the analogy of examples
derived from notices of Britons, Kelts and Wends, in Strabo, Polybius
and Dio Cassius. See p. 52, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. Thus, according to his view, Suevi (Suáp, Swǽf) denotes the wanderers;
Wandal also the wanderers. Assuredly if nations at large partook
of such habits, single tribes could not have derived a name from
the custom. How much more easy would it be, upon similar etymological
grounds, to prove that the leading Teutonic nations were named
from their weapons! Saxons from <em>seax</em>, the long knife; Angles from
<em>angol</em>, a hook; Franks from <em>franca</em>, a javelin; Langobards and Heaðobards
from <em>barda</em>, the axe or halberd; nay even the general name
itself, Germans, from <em>gárman</em> (Old Germ. <em>kérman</em>) the javelin- or goad-man.
Yet who would assert these to be satisfactory derivations? Zahn,
whose services to Old German literature cannot be overrated, speaks
wisely when he calls the similarity of proper names, a rock “on which
uncritical heads are much in the habit of splitting.” Vorrede zu
Ulphilas, p. 3.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. Grimm is of opinion that the word Marc itself originally denoted
<em>forest</em>, and that the modern sense is a secondary one, derived from the
fact of forests being the signs or marks of communities. Deut. Gränzalterthümer;
Berl. 1844. There can be no doubt that forests were so:
in Old Norse the two ideas, and the words by which they are expressed,
flow into one another: Mörk (f) is <em>silva</em>, Mark (n) is <em>limes</em>. In the
Edda and Sögur, Myrkviðr is the common name for a wood: thus,
sem þessi her kom saman, riða þeir á skóg þan er Myrkviðr heitir,
hann skilr Húnaland ok Reiðgota land; they ride to the forest which
is called Myrkviðr (mearcwidu in Anglosaxon) which separates Huna
land from Reidgota land. Fornm. Sög. i. 496. Though given here as

<p class='c001'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. Tacitus says of the Semnones: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stato tempore in silvam, auguriis

legationibus coeunt, caesoque publice homine celebrant barbari ritus
horrenda primordia. Est et alia luco reverentia. Nemo nisi vinculo
ligatus ingreditur, ut minor, et potestatem numinis prae se ferens. Si
forte prolapsus est, attolli et insurgere haud licitum, per humum evolvuntur:
eoque omnis superstitio respicit, tanquam inde initia gentis,
ibi regnator omnium deus, cetera subiecta atque parentia.</span>” Germ. 39.
Again: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apud Naharvalos antiquae religionis lucus ostenditur.</span>”
Ibid. 43. Without asserting the existence of the Mark among the
Greeks with all the peculiar German characteristics, we may borrow
from them an illustration and definition of its nature. Between the
territories of the Athenians and Megareans lay a tract of land, the cultivation
of which by the latter formed the pretext or justification of the
excommunication launched against them by “Olympian” Pericles,
which ultimately led to the Peloponesian war, and the downfal of
Athens. The Athenians, Thucydides tells us, refused to rescind their
intemperate decree, ἐπικαλοῦντες ἐπεργασίαν Μεγαρεῦσι τῆς γῆς τῆς
ἱερας καὶ τῆς ἀορίστου· (Lib. i. 139), where the Scholiast explains ἀορίστου
by οὐ σπειρομένης. <em>Sacred and not divided into plots for cultivation
by the plough</em>, is the exact definition of a Teutonic Mark. Compare
χοίριος νάπη (silva porcina) between Laconia and Messenia. Paus. iv. 1.
In the legend of St. Gúðlác, the saint is said to occupy the desert wilderness,
mearclond, the mark (Codex Exoniensis, p. 112, l. 16), and this is
accurately defined as <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ídel ⁊ ǽmen, éðelrihte feor</span>, <em>empty and uninhabited,

Lords Marchers or Lords of the Marches of Wales and Scotland.
Harald was lord of the Marches against the Welsh. And so the hereditary
Markgraves or Counts of the Mark, Marchiones, have become
kings in Germany and Italy. Our only Markgraviats by land could
be against the Welsh on the west, the Picts and Scots on the north.
There were undoubtedly others among the Saxons while their kingdoms
remained unsettled: but not when once the whole realm became
united under Æðelstán. The consolidation of the English power has
put down all but transmarine invaders; hence the sea is become our
Mark, and the commanders of our ships, the Margraves. But, as
Blackstone rather beautifully says, “water is a wandering and uncertain
thing,” and our Margraves therefore establish no territorial authority.

<p class='c001'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. These local denominations are for the most part irregular compositions,
of which the former portion is a patronymic in -ing or -ling,
declined in the genitive plural. The second portion is a mere definition
of the locality, as -geat, -hyrst, -hám, -wíc, -tún, -stede, and the
like. In a few cases the patronymic stands alone in the nominative
plural, as Tótingas, Tooting, Surrey; Wócingas, Woking, Surrey;
Meallingas, Malling, Kent; Weðeringas, Wittering, Sussex. In a still
smaller number, the name of the eponymus replaces that of his descendants,
as Finnes burh, Finsbury; Wælses hám, Walsham, in Norfolk;
in which last name, as well as in Wælses eafora (Beówulf, l. 1787), we
have a record of the progenitor of the Wælsings, who is alike unknown
to the Scandinavian and the German legends of that noble race. In
dealing, however, with these names, some amount of caution is necessary:
it is by no means enough that a word should end in -ing, to
convert it into a genuine patronymic. On the contrary it is a power of
that termination to denote the genitive or possessive, which is also the
generative, case: and in some local names we do find it so used: thus
Æðelwulfing lond (Cod. Dipl. No. 179, a. 801) is exactly equivalent to
Æðelwulfes lond, the estate of a duke Æðelwulf, not of a family called
Æðelwulfings. So again, ðæt Folcwining lond (Cod. Dipl. No. 195,
a. 811), ðæt Wynhearding lond (Cod. Dipl. No. 195, a. 811), imply the
land of Folcwine, of Wynheard, not of marks or families called Folcwinings
and Wynheardings. Woolbedington, Wool Lavington, Barlavington,
are respectively Wulfbæding tún, Wulfláfing tún, Beórláfing
tún, the tún or dwelling of Wulfláf, Wulfbæd and Beórláf. Between
such words and genuine patronymics the line must carefully be drawn,
a task which requires both skill and experience: the best security is,
where we find the patronymic in the genitive plural: but one can very
generally judge whether the name is such as to have arisen in the way
described above, from a genitive singular. Changes for the sake of
euphony must also be guarded against, as sources of error: thus Abingdon
in Berks would impel us strongly to assume a family of Abingas;
the Saxon name Æbban dún convinces us that it was named from an
Æbba (m.) or Æbbe (f). Dunnington is not Duninga tún, but Dunnan,
that is Dunna’s tún.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER III.<br /> THE GÁ OR SCÍR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Next in order of constitution, if not of time, is the
union of two, three or more Marks in a federal
bond for purposes of a religious, judicial or even
political character. The technical name for such
a union is in Germany, a Gau or Bant<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c008'><sup>[126]</sup></a>; in England
the ancient name Gá has been almost universally
superseded by that of Scír or Shire. For the
most part the natural divisions of the country are
the divisions also of the Gá; and the size of this
depends upon such accidental limits as well as upon
the character and dispositions of the several collective
bodies which we have called Marks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Gá is the second and final form of unsevered
possession; for every larger aggregate is but the result
of a gradual reduction of such districts, under
a higher political or administrative unity, different
only in degree and not in kind from what prevailed
individually in each. The kingdom is only a larger
Gá than ordinary; indeed the Gá itself was the
original kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the unsevered possession or property which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>we thus find in the Gá is by no means to be considered
in the same light as that which has been described
in the Mark. The inhabitants are settled
as Markmen, not as Gá-men: the cultivated land
which lies within the limits of the larger community
is all distributed into the smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the Mark contained within itself the means of
doing right between man and man, <i>i. e.</i>, its Markmót;
as it had its principal officer or judge, and
beyond a doubt its priest and place of religious observances,
so the County, Scír or Gá had all these
on a larger and more imposing scale; and thus it
was enabled to do right between Mark and Mark,
as well as between man and man, and to decide
those differences the arrangement of which transcended
the powers of the smaller body. If the
elders and leaders of the Mark could settle the
mode of conducting the internal affairs of their district,
so the elders and leaders of the Gá (the same
leading markmen in a corporate capacity) could
decide upon the weightier causes that affected the
whole community; and thus the Scírgemót or
Shiremoot was the completion of a system of which
the Mearcmót was the foundation. Similarly, as
the several smaller units had arrangements on a corresponding
scale for divine service, so the greater
and more important religious celebrations in which
all the Marks took part, could only be performed
under the auspices and by the authority of the Gá.
Thus alone could due provision be made for sacrifices
which would have been too onerous for a small
and poor district, and an equalization of burthens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>be effected; while the machinery of government
and efficient means of protection were secured.</p>

<p class='c001'>At these great religious rites, accompanied as they
ever were by the solemn Ðing, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>placitum</i></span> or court,
thrice in the year the markmen assembled unbidden:
and here they transacted the ordinary and routine
business required. On emergencies however,
which did not brook delay, the leaders could issue
their peremptory summons to a bidden Ðing, and
in this were then decided the measures necessary
for the maintenance and well-being of the community,
and the mutual guarantee of life and honour.
To the Gá then probably belonged, as an unsevered
possession, the lands necessary for the site and
maintenance of a temple, the supply of beasts for
sacrifice, and the endowment of a priest or priests:
perhaps also for the erection of a stockade or fortress,
and some shelter for the assembled freemen
in the Ðing. Moreover, if land existed which from
any cause had not been included within the limits
of some Mark, we may believe that it became the
public property of the Gá, <i>i. e.</i>, of all the Marks in
their corporate capacity: this at least may be inferred
from the rights exercised at a comparatively
later period over waste lands, by the constituted
authorities, the Duke, Count or King.</p>

<p class='c001'>Accident must more or less have determined the
seat of the Gá-jurisdiction: perhaps here and there
some powerful leading Mark, already in the possession
of a holy site, may have drawn the neighbouring
settlers into its territory: but as the possession
and guardianship of the seat of government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>could not but lead to the vindication of certain
privileges and material advantages to its holders,
it is not unreasonable to believe that where the
Marks coalesced on equal terms, the temple-lands
would be placed without the peculiar territorial
possession of each, as they often were in Greece,
upon the ἐσχατιὰ or boundary-land. On the summit
of a range of hills, whose valleys sufficed for
the cultivation of the markmen, on the watershed
from which the fertilizing streams descended, at
the point where the boundaries of two or three communities
touched one another, was the proper place
for the common periodical assemblages of the free
men: and such sites, marked even to this day by
a few venerable oaks, may be observed in various
parts of England<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c008'><sup>[127]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The description which has been given might seem
at first more properly to relate to an abstract political
unity than to a real and territorial one: no
doubt the most important quality of the Gá or Scír
was its power of uniting distinct populations for
public purposes: in this respect it resembled the
shire, while the sheriff’s court was still of some importance;
or even yet, where the judges coming
on their circuit, under a commission, hold a shiremoot
or court in each shire for gaol-delivery. Yet
the Shire is a territorial division<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c008'><sup>[128]</sup></a> as well as an abstract
and merely legal formulary, although all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>land comprised within it is divided into parishes,
hamlets, vills and liberties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strictly speaking, the Shire, apart from the units
that make it up, possesses little more land than
that which the town-hall, the gaol, or the hospital
may cover. When for the two latter institutions
we substitute the fortress of the king, and
a cathedral, which was the people’s and not the
bishop’s, we have as nearly as possible the Anglosaxon
shire-property, and the identity of the two
divisions seems proved. Just as the Gá (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pagus</i></span>)
contains the Marks (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicos</i></span>), and the territory of
them all, taken together, makes up the territory of
the Gá, so does the Shire contain hamlets, parishes
and liberties, and its territorial expanse is distributed
into them. As then the word Mark is used
to denote two distinct things,—a territorial division
and a corporate body,—so does the word Gá or
Scír denote both a machinery for government and
a district in which such machinery prevails. The
number of Marks included in a single Gá must have
varied partly with the variations of the land itself,
its valleys, hills and meadows: to this cause may
have been added others arising, to some extent,
from the original military organization and distribution,
from the personal character of a leader, or
from the peculiar tenets and customs of a particular
Mark. But proximity, and settlement upon the
same land, with the accompanying participation
in the advantages of wood and water, are ever the
most active means of uniting men in religious and
social communities; and it is therefore reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to believe that the influence most felt in the arrangement
of the several Gás was in fact a territorial
one, depending upon the natural conformation
of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of the modern shire-divisions of England
in all probability have remained unchanged from
the earliest times; so that here and there a now
existent Shire may be identical in territory with an
ancient Gá. But it may be doubted whether this
observation can be very extensively applied: obscure
as is the record of our old divisions, what
little we know, favours the supposition that the original
Gás were not only more numerous than our
Shires, but that these were not always identical in
their boundaries with those Gás whose locality can
be determined.</p>

<p class='c001'>The policy or pedantry of Norman chroniclers
has led them to pass over in silence the names
of the ancient divisions, which nevertheless were
known to them<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c008'><sup>[129]</sup></a>. Wherever they have occasion to
refer to our Shires, they do so by the names they
still bear; thus Florence of Worcester and William of
Malmesbury name, to the south of the Humber, Kent,
Wiltshire, Berkshire, Dorset, Sussex, Southampton,
Surrey, Somerset, Devonshire, Cornwall, Gloucester,
Worcester, Warwick, Cheshire, Derby, Stafford,
Shropshire, Hereford, Oxford, Buckingham,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Hertford, Huntingdon, Bedford, Northampton, Leicester,
Lincoln, Nottingham, Cambridge, Norfolk,
Suffolk and Essex, comprising with Middlesex
thirty-two of the shires, out of forty into which
England is now distributed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even these names and divisions are of great
antiquity: Asser, in his life of Ælfred, mentions by
name, Berkshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Somerset,
Sussex, Lincoln, Dorset, Devon, Wiltshire and
Southampton, being a third of the whole number:
unfortunately, from his work being composed in
Latin and his consequent use of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>paga</i></span>, we cannot
tell how many of these divisions were considered
by him as Scír.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Saxon Chronicles, during the period anterior
to the reign of Ælfred, seem to know only
the old general divisions: thus we have Cantwara
land, Kent<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c008'><sup>[130]</sup></a>; Westseaxan, Súðseaxan, Eástseaxan,
Middleseaxan, Wessex, Sussex, Essex, Middlesex:
Eástengle, Eastanglia: Norðanhymbra land, Súðanhymbra
land, Myrcna land, Northumberland,
Southumberland, Mercia: Lindisware and Lindisse,
Lincolnshire: Súðrige, Surrey; Wiht, the Isle of
Wight; Hwiccas, the Hwiccii in Gloucestershire
and Worcestershire<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c008'><sup>[131]</sup></a>; Merscware, the people of
Romney Marsh: Wilsætan, Dornsætan and Sumorsætan,
Wiltshire, Dorsetshire and Somersetshire<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c008'><sup>[132]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>But after the time of Ælfred, the different manuscripts
of the Chronicles usually adopt the word
Scír, in the same places as we do, and with the same
meaning. Thus we find, Bearrucscír, Bedanfordscír,
Buccingahámscír, Defenascír, Deórabyscír,
Eoforwícscír, Gleáwanceasterscír, Grantabrycgscír,
Hámtúnscír (Southampton), Hámtúnscír (Northampton),
Heortfordscír, Herefordscír, Huntandúnscír,
Legeceasterscír, Lindicolnascír, Oxnafordscír,
Scrobbesbyrigscír (but also Scrobsetan), Snotingahámscír,
Stæffordscír, Wæringwícscír or Wæringscír,
Wigraceasterscír, and Wiltunscír: Middelseaxe,
Eástseaxe, Súðseaxe, Súðrige and Cent remain:
Eástengle is not divided into Norfolk and
Suffolk. Thus, out of the thirty-two shires south
of the Humber, which Florence and William of
Malmesbury mention, the Chronicles note twenty-six,
of which twenty-one are distinguished as <em>shires</em>
by the word scír.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Beda nothing of the kind is to be found: the
general scope of his Ecclesiastical History rendered
it unnecessary for him to descend to minute details,
and besides the names of races and kingdoms, he
mentions few divisions of the land. Still he notices
the Provincia Huicciorum: the Middelangli or
Angli Mediterranei, a portion of the Mercians: the
Mercii Australes and Aquilonales: the Regio Sudergeona
or Surrey: the Regio Loidis or Elmet near
York: the Provincia Meanwarorum, or Hundreds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of East and West Meon in Southampton; the Regio
Gyrwiorum in which Peterborough lies, and distinct
from this, the Australes Gyrwii or South
Gyrwians.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Appendix to the Chronicles of Florence of
Worcester supplies us with one or two names of
small districts, not commonly found in other authors.
One of these is the Mercian district of the
Westangles or West Hecan, ruled over by Merewald;
in whose country were the Mægsetan, or
people of Hereford, who are sometimes reckoned
to the Hwiccas, or inhabitants of Worcester and
Gloucester<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c008'><sup>[133]</sup></a>. Another, the Middleangles, had its
bishopric in Leicester: the Southangles, whose bishop
sat at Dorchester in Oxfordshire, consequently
comprised the counties down to the Thames. The
Northangles or Mercians proper had their bishop in
Lichfield. Lastly it has been recorded that Malmesbury
in Wiltshire was in Provincia Septonia<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c008'><sup>[134]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But we are not altogether without the means of
carrying this enquiry further. We have a record
of the divisions which must have preceded the distribution
of this country into shires: they are unfortunately
not numerous, and the names are generally
very difficult to explain: they have so long
become obsolete, that it is now scarcely possible to
identify them. Nor need this cause surprise, when
we compare the oblivion into which they have fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>with the sturdy resistance offered by the names
of the Marks, and their long continuance throughout
all the changes which have befallen our race.
The Gás, which were only political bodies, became
readily swallowed up and lost in shires and kingdoms:
the Marks, which had an individual being,
and as it were personality of their own, passed
easily from one system of aggregations to another,
without losing anything of their peculiar character:
and at a later period it will be seen that this individuality
became perpetuated by the operation of
our ecclesiastical institutions.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very important document is printed by Sir
Henry Spelman in his Glossary, under the head
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Hida</i></span>. In its present condition it is comparatively
modern, but many of the entries supply us with
information obviously derived from the most remote
antiquity, and these it becomes proper to
take into consideration. The document seems to
have been intended as a guide either to the taxation
or the military force of the kingdom, and professes
to give the number of hides of land contained in
the various districts. It runs as follows<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c008'><sup>[135]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c001'>The entries respecting Mercia, Eastanglia and
Wessex could hardly belong to any period anterior
to that of Ælfred. For Mercia previous to the
Danish wars must certainly have contained more
than 30,000 hides: while Eastanglia cannot have
reached so large a sum till settled by Guðorm’s
Danes: nor is it easy to believe that Wessex, apart
from Kent and Sussex, should have numbered
one hundred thousand in the counties of Surrey,
Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, with parts of Berkshire,
Somerset and Devon, much before the time
of Æðelstán<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c008'><sup>[137]</sup></a>. A remarkable variation is found
between the amounts stated in this list and
those given by Beda, as respects some of the entries:
thus Mercia, here valued at 30,000 hides, is
reckoned in the Ecclesiastical History at 12,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>only<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c008'><sup>[138]</sup></a>: Hwiccas are reckoned at 300: they contained
600 hides; Wight, reckoned at 600, contained
1200. On the other hand Kent and Sussex
are retained at the ancient valuation.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is nevertheless impossible to doubt that the
greater number of the names recorded in this list
are genuine, and of the highest antiquity. A few
of them can be recognized in the pages of very
early writers: thus Gyrwa, Elmet, Lindisfaran,
Wihtgare, and Hwiccas, are mentioned by Beda in
the eighth century. Some we are still able to identify
with modern districts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mercia I imagine to be that portion of Burgred’s
kingdom, which upon its division by the victorious
Danes in 874, they committed as a tributary royalty
to Ceólwulf; which subsequently came into the
hands of Ælfred, by the treaty of Wedmor in 878,
and was by him erected into a duchy under his
daughter Æðelflǽd, and her husband. Wokensetna
may possibly be the Gá of the Wrocensetan, the
people about the Wrekin or hill-country of Somerset,
Dorset and Devon. The Pecsetan appear to be
the inhabitants of the Peakland, or Derbyshire: the
Elmedsetan, those of Elmet, the ancient British
Loidis, an independent district in Yorkshire: Lindisfaran
are the people of Lindisse, a portion of
Lincolnshire: North and South Gyrwa were probably
in the Mark between Eastanglia and Mercia:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>as Peterborough was in North Gyrwa land, this
must have comprised a part of Northamptonshire:
and Æðelðrýð derived her right to Ely from her
first husband, a prince of the South Gyrwians; this
district is therefore supposed to have extended over
a part of Cambridgeshire and the isle of Ely. Spalda
may be the tract stretching to the north-east of
these, upon the river Welland, in which still lies
Spalding. The Hwiccas occupied Worcestershire
and Gloucestershire<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c008'><sup>[139]</sup></a>, and perhaps extended into
Herefordshire, to the west of the Severn. The
Wihtgaras are the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight;
and the Cilternsetan were the people who owned
the hill and forest land about the Chilterns, verging
towards Oxfordshire, and very probably in the
Mark between Mercia and Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>I fear that it will be impossible to identify any
more of these names, and it does not appear probable
that they supply us with anything like a complete
catalogue of the English Gás. Setting aside
the fact, that no notice seems to be taken of Northumberland,
save the mention of the little principality
of Elmet, and that the local divisions of
Eastanglia, Kent, Essex, Sussex and Wessex are
passed over in the general names of the kingdoms,
we look in vain among them for names known to
us from other sources, and which can hardly have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>been other than those of Gás. Thus we have no
mention of the Tonsetan, whose district lay apparently
upon the banks of the Severn<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c008'><sup>[140]</sup></a>; of the Meanware,
or land of the Jutes, in Hampshire; of the
Mægsetan, or West Hecan, in Herefordshire; of the
Merscware in West Kent; or of the Gedingas, who
occupied a tract in the province of Middlesex<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c008'><sup>[141]</sup></a>.
Although it is possible that these divisions are included
in some of the larger units mentioned in our
list, they still furnish an argument that the names
of the Gás were much more numerous than they
would appear from the list itself, and that this
marks only a period of transition.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is clear that when William of Malmesbury mentions
thirty-two shires as making up the whole of England,
he intends only England south of the Humber.
The list we have been examining contains thirty-four
entries; of all the names therein recorded, one
only can be shown to lie to the north of that river:
from this however it is not unreasonable to suppose
that the whole of England is intended to be comprised
in the catalogue. Even admitting this, we
cannot but conclude that these divisions were more
numerous than our shires, seeing that large districts,
such as Mercia, Wessex and Eastanglia, are entered
only under one general head respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>The origin of the Gá in the federal union of two
or more Marks is natural, and must be referred to
periods far anterior to any historical record: that
of the division into Shires, as well as the period
at which this arose, are less easily determined.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>But we have evidence that some division into shires
was known in Wessex as early as the end of the
seventh or beginning of the eighth century, since
Ini provides for the case where a plaintiff cannot
obtain justice from his shireman or judge<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c008'><sup>[142]</sup></a>; and
the same prince declares that if an ealdorman compounds
a felony, he shall forfeit his shire<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c008'><sup>[143]</sup></a>; while
he further enacts that no man shall secretly withdraw
from his lord into another shire<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c008'><sup>[144]</sup></a>. As it will
be shown hereafter that a territorial jurisdiction is
inseparably connected with the rank of a duke or
ealdorman, I take the appearance of these officers
in Mercia, during the same early period, to be evidence
of the existence of a similar division there.
Its cause appears to me to lie in the consolidation
of the royal power. As long as independent associations
of freemen were enabled to maintain their
natural liberties, to administer their own affairs undisturbed
by the power of strangers, and by means
of their own private alliances to defend their territories
and their rights, the old division into Gás
might continue to exist. But the centralization of
power in the hands of the king implies a more artificial
system. It is more convenient for judicial
and administrative purposes, more profitable, and
more safe for the ruler, to have districts governed
by his own officers, and in which a territorial unity
shall supersede the old bonds of kinsmanship: centralization
is hardly compatible with family tradition.
The members of the Gá met as associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>freemen, under the guidance of their own natural
leaders, and formed a substantive unit or small
state, which might, or might not, stand in relations
of amity to similar states. The Shire was a political
division, presided over by an appointed officer,
forming part only of a general system, and no longer
endowed with the high political rights of self-government,
in their fullest extent. I can imagine the Gá,
but certainly not the Shire, declaring war against
a neighbour. As long as the Gá could maintain
itself as a little republic, principality, or even kingdom,
it might exist unscathed: but as the smaller
kings were rooted out, their lands and people incorporated
with larger unions, and powerful monarchies
rose upon their ruins, it is natural that a
system of districts should arise, based entirely upon
a territorial division. Such districts, without peculiar,
individual character of their own, or principle
of internal cohesion, must have appeared less dangerous
to usurpation than the ancient gentile aggregations.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER IV. <br /> LANDED POSSESSION. THE EÐEL, HÍD OR ALOD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Possession of a certain amount of land in the district
was the indispensable condition of enjoying
the privileges and exercising the rights of a freeman<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c008'><sup>[145]</sup></a>.
There is no trace of such a qualification as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>constituted citizenship at Athens or Rome: among
our forefathers, the exclusive idea of the <em>city</em> had
indeed no sway. They formed voluntary associations
upon the land, for mutual benefit; the qualification
by birth, as far as it could be of any importance,
was inferred from the fact of admission
among the community; and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gelondan</i></span>, or those who
occupied the same land, were taken to be connected
in blood<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c008'><sup>[146]</sup></a>. An inquiry into the pedigree of a man
who presented himself to share in the perils of the
conquest or the settlement, would assuredly have
appeared superfluous; nor was it more likely to be
made, when secure enjoyment came to reward the
labours of invasion. In fact the Germanic settlements,
whether in their origin isolated or collective,
are based throughout upon the idea of common
property in land. It is not the city, but the country,
that regulates their form of life and social institutions:
as Tacitus knew them, they bore in general
the character of disliking cities: “It is well
enough known,” he says, “that none of the German
populations dwell in cities; nay that they
will not even suffer continuous building, and house
joined to house. They live apart, each by himself,
as the woodside, the plain or the fresh spring attracted
him”<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c008'><sup>[147]</sup></a>. Thus the Germanic community is
in some sense <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>adstricta glebae</i></span>, bound to the soil:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>its members are sharers in the arable, the forest and
the marsh, the waters and the pastures: their bond
of union is a partnership in the advantages to be
derived from possession of the land, an individual
interest in a common benefit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The district occupied by a body of new settlers
was divided by lot in various proportions<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c008'><sup>[148]</sup></a>. Yet it
is certain that not all the land was so distributed;
a quantity sufficient to supply a proper block of
arable<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c008'><sup>[149]</sup></a> to each settler, was set apart for division;
while the surplus fitted for cultivation, the
marshes and forests less suited to the operations of
the plough, and a great amount of fine grass or
meadow-land, destined for the maintenance of cattle,
remained in undivided possession as commons.
At first too, it is clear, from what has been said in
the second chapter, that considerable tracts were
left purposely out of cultivation to form the marches
or defences of the several communities. But those
alone whose share in the arable demonstrated them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to be members of the little state, could hope to participate
in the advantages of the commons of pasture:
like the old Roman patricians, they derived
from their <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>haeredium</i></span> benefits totally incommensurate
with its extent. Without such share of the
arable, the man formed no portion of the state; it
was his franchise, his political qualification, even
as a very few years ago a freehold of inconsiderable
amount sufficed to enable an Englishman to
vote, or even be voted for, as a member of the
legislature,—to be, as the Greeks would call it, in
the πολιτεία,—a privilege which the utmost wealth
in copyhold estates or chattels could not confer.
He that had no land was at first unfree: he could
not represent himself and his interests in the courts
or assemblies of the freemen, but must remain in
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mund</i></span> or hand of another<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c008'><sup>[150]</sup></a>,—a necessary consequence
of a state of society in which there is
indeed no property but land, in other words, no
market for its produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the mode of distribution it is probable
that each share was originally called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hlyt</span> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sors</i></span>,
κλῆρος), it derived however another and more common
name from its extent and nature. The ordinary
Anglosaxon words are Higid<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c008'><sup>[151]</sup></a> (in its contracted
and almost universal form Híd) and Hiwisc. The
Latin equivalents which we find in the chronicles
and charters are, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>familia</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cassatus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mansus</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mansa</i></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mansio</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>martens</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra tributarii</i></span>. The words
Híd and Hiwisc are similar, if not identical, in
meaning: they stand in close etymological relation
to Higan, Hiwan, the family, the man and wife,
and thus perfectly justify the Latin terms <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>familia</i></span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cassatus</i></span><a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c008'><sup>[152]</sup></a>, by which they are translated. The
Híd then, or Hide of land, is the estate of one
household, the amount of land sufficient for the
support of one family<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c008'><sup>[153]</sup></a>. It is clear however that
this could not be an invariable quantity, if the
households were to be subsisted on an equal scale:
it must depend upon the original quality and condition
of the soil, as well as upon manifold contingencies
of situation—climate, aspect, accessibility
of water and roads, abundance of natural manures,
proximity of marshes and forests, in short an endless
catalogue of varying details. If therefore the
Hide contained a fixed number of acres all over
England, and all the freemen were to be placed in a
position of equal prosperity, we must assume that
in the less favoured districts one Hide would not
suffice for the establishment of one man, but that
his allotment must have comprised more than that
quantity. The first of these hypotheses may be
very easily disposed of: there is not the slightest
ground for supposing that any attempt was, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>could be, made to regulate the amount of individual
possession beyond the limit of each community; or
that there ever was, or could be, any concert between
different communities for such a purpose.
The second supposition however presents greater
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt a strong antecedent improbability
of the Hide having been alike all over England:
isolated as were the various conquests which
gradually established the Saxon rule in the several
districts, it can hardly be supposed that any agreement
was at first found among bands, engaged in
continual struggles for safety, rather than for extension
of territory. It may indeed be objected
that later, when the work of conquest had been
consolidated, when, under the rule of powerful chieftains,
the resistance of the Britons had ceased to
appear dangerous, some steps may have been taken
towards a general arrangement; those historians
who please themselves with the phantom of a Saxon
confederation under one imperial head,—a Bretwaldadóm—may
find therein an easy solution of this,
and many other difficulties<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c008'><sup>[154]</sup></a>: but still it seems
little likely that the important step of dividing the
country should have been postponed, or that a successful
body of invaders should have thought it
necessary to wait for the consent or co-operation of
others, whose ultimate triumph was yet uncertain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Experience of human nature would rather incline
us to believe that, as each band wrung from the
old masters of the soil as much as sufficed for its
own support and safety, it hastened to realize its
position and marked its acquisition by the stamp
and impress of individual possession. It is moreover
probable that, had any solemn and general
agreement been brought about through the influence
of any one predominant chief, we should
not have been left without some record of a fact,
so beneficial in itself, and so conclusive as to the
power and wisdom of its author: this we might
not unreasonably expect, even though we admit
that such an event could only have taken place at
the very commencement of our history, and that
such a division, or, what is more difficult still, redivision
of the soil, is totally inconsistent with the
state of society in England at any period subsequent
to <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 600: but these are precisely the
cases where the mythus replaces and is ancillary
to history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Against all these arguments we have only one
fact to adduce, but it is no light one. It is certain
that, in all the cases where a calculation can be made
at all, we do find a most striking coincidence with
respect to the size of the Hide in various parts of
England; that such calculation is applicable to very
numerous instances, and apparently satisfies the
condition of the problem in all; and lastly that
there appears no reason to suppose that any such
real change had taken place in the value of the Hide,
down to the period of the Norman conquest and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>compilation of Domesday, according to the admeasurement
of at least the largest and the most influential
of the English tribes<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c008'><sup>[155]</sup></a>. The latest of these
measurements are recorded in Domesday; the earliest
by Beda: the same system of calculations, the
same results, apply to every case in which trial has
been made between these remote limits; and we are
thus enabled to ascend to the seventh century, a
period at which any equality of possessions is entirely
out of the question, but at which the old unit
of measurement may still have retained and handed
down its original value: even as, with us, one farm
may comprise a thousand, another only two or
three hundred acres, and yet the extent of the acre
remain unaltered.</p>

<p class='c001'>How then are we to account for this surprising
fact, in the face of the arguments thus arrayed
against it? I cannot positively assert, but still
think it highly probable, that there was some such
general measure common to the Germanic tribes
upon the continent, and especially in the north.
Whether originally sacerdotal, or how settled, it is
useless to guess; but there does seem reason to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that a measure not widely different from the
result of my own calculations as to the Hide, prevailed
in Germany; and hence to conclude that
it was the usual basis of measurement among all
the tribes that issued from the storehouse of nations<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c008'><sup>[156]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>What was the amount then of the Hide among
the Anglosaxons? Perhaps the easiest way of
arriving at a trustworthy conclusion will be to
commence with the Anglosaxon acre, and other
subdivisions of the Hide and the acre itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is reason to believe that the latter measure
implied ordinarily a quantity of land not very different
in amount from our own statute acre<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c008'><sup>[157]</sup></a>. I
argue this from a passage in the dialogue attributed
to Ælfríc, where the ploughman is made to say:
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ac geiúcodan oxan and gefæstnodan sceare and
cultre mid ðǽre syl ælce dæg ic sceal erian fulne
æcer oððe máre;</span>” that is, “having yoked my oxen,
and fastened my share and coulter, I am bound to
plough every day a full acre or more.” Now experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>proves<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c008'><sup>[158]</sup></a> that a plough drawn by oxen will
hardly exceed this measure upon average land at
the present day; an acre and a quarter would be
a very hard day’s work for any ploughman under
such circumstances. Hence for all practical purposes
we may assume our actual acre not to differ
very materially from the Anglosaxon. And now,
how is an acre constituted?</p>

<p class='c001'>It has many divisors, all multiplying into the required
sum of 4840 square yards. Thus, it is clear
that a length of 4840 yards, with a breadth of
one yard, is quite as much an acre as a length of
220 yards with a breadth of 22 (in other words,
ten chains by one, or 22 × 10 × 22,) the usual
and legal computation: that is to say, twenty-two
strips of land each 220 yards long and one wide,
if placed together in any position will make up an
acre. Placed side by side they will make an oblong
acre whose length and breadth are as 10:1.
A space rather more than sixty-nine and less than
seventy yards in each side would be a square acre;
it is however not probable that the land generally
allowed of square divisions, but rather that the
portions were oblong, a circumstance in favour of
the ploughman, whose labour varies very much with
the length of the furrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present divisors of the acre are 5·5 and 40;
combinations of these numbers make up the parts
not only of the acre or square measure, but also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the measure of length. Thus 5·5 × 40 = 220, which
taken in yards are one furlong, and which with
one yard’s breadth are <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>22</sub> of an acre. Again, forty
times 5·5 yards with a breadth of 5·5 yards (or 220
× 5·5) are 1210 yards square, ·25 of an acre: twice
that, or forty times 5·5 with a breadth of eleven
yards are ·5 acre: and twice that, or 220 × 20 (that
is in modern surveying ten chains by one) = 4840
yards or the whole acre. The same thing may be
expressed in another way: we may assume a square
of 5·5 yards, which is called a rod, perch, or pole:
forty of these make a rood, which is a furlong with
a breadth of 5·5 yards; and four such roods, or a
furlong with a breadth of twenty-two yards, are an
acre of the oblong form described above, and which
is still the normal or legal acre.</p>

<p class='c001'>My hypothesis goes on to assume that such, or
nearly such, were the elements of the original calculation:
in fact, that they were entirely so, with
the substitution only of 5 for 5·5 as a factor. It
remains to be asked why these numbers should be
fixed upon? Probably from some notion of the
mystical properties of the numbers themselves.
Forty and eight are of continual recurrence in
Anglosaxon tradition, and may be considered as
their sacerdotal or mythical numbers: forty divided
by eight gives a quotient of five; and these may
have been the original factors, especially if, as there
is every reason to believe, the first division of lands
(whether here or on the continent matters not)
took place under the authority and with the assistance
of the heathen priesthood.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this were so, the Saxon acre very probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>consisted of 5 × 5 × 40 × 4 = 4000 square yards<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c008'><sup>[159]</sup></a>;
in which case the rod would be 25 yards square,
and the furlong 200 yards in length. At the same
time as the acres must be considered equal for
all the purposes of useful calculation, 4000 Saxon
square yards = 4840 English, 5 Saxon = 5·5 English,
and 200 Saxon = 220 English yards. Further,
the Saxon yard = 1·1 English, or 39·6 inches. This
I imagine to be the metgyrde or measuring-yard of
the Saxon Laws<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c008'><sup>[160]</sup></a>. If then we take 5 × 5 × 40 yards
we have a block of land, 200 Saxon yards in length,
and five in breadth; and this I consider to have
been the Saxon square Furlang or small acre, and
to have been exactly equal to our rood, the quarantena
of early calculations<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c008'><sup>[161]</sup></a>. There is no doubt whatever
of the Saxon furlang having been a square as
well as long measure<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c008'><sup>[162]</sup></a>; as its name denotes, it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>length of a furrow: now 220 (= 200 Saxon) yards is
not at all too long a side for a field in our modern
husbandry<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c008'><sup>[163]</sup></a>, and is still more readily conceivable in
a less artificial system, where there was altogether
less enclosure, and the rotations of crops were
fewer. Five yards, or five and a half, is not too
much space to allow for the turn of the plough;
and it therefore seems not improbable that such an
oblong block (200 × 5) should have been assumed
as a settled measure or furlong for the ploughman,
two being taken alternately, as is done at this day,
in working, and forming a good half-day’s work for
man and beast: the length of the furrow, by which
the labour of the ploughman is greatly reduced,
being taken to compensate for the improved character
of our implements.</p>

<p class='c001'>I think it extremely probable that the Saxons
had a large and a small acre, as well as a large and
small hundred, and a large and small yard: and
also that the quarantena or rood was this small
acre. Taking forty quarantenae we have a sum of
ten large acres, and taking three times that number
we have 120 quarantenae, or a large hundred of
small acres = 30 large acres, giving ten to each
course of a threefold system of husbandry. This
on the whole seems a near approximation to the
value of the Hide of land; and the calculation of
small acres would then help to account for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>number of 120 which is assigned to the Hide by
some authorities<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c008'><sup>[164]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the <a href='#app_B'>appendix</a> to this chapter I have given
various calculations to prove that in Domesday
the value of a Hide is forty Norman acres. It has
been asserted that 100 Saxon = 120 Norman acres,
and if so 40 Norman = 33⅓ Saxon: which does not
differ very widely from the calculation given above.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be borne in mind that the Hide comprised
only arable land: the meadow and pasture
was in the common lands and forests, and was
attached to the Hide as of common right: under
these circumstances if the calculation of thirty,
thirty-two or thirty-three acres be correct, we shall
see that ample provision was made for the family<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c008'><sup>[165]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now apply these data to places of which
we know the hidage, and compare this with the
modern contents in statute-acres.</p>

<p class='c001'>According to Beda<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c008'><sup>[166]</sup></a> the Isle of Wight contained
1200 hides or families: now the island contains
86,810 acres, which would give 72⅓ acres per hide.
But only 75,000 acres are under cultivation now,
and this would reduce our quotient to 62·5 acres.
On the hypothesis that in such a spot as the Isle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of Wight (in great portions of which vegetation is
not abundant) our Saxon forefathers had half as
much under cultivation as we now have, we should
obtain a quotient of about thirty-one acres to the
hide, leaving 49,610 acres of pasture, waste, etc.: the
ratio between the cultivated and uncultivated land,
being about 37:49, is much too near equality for
the general ratio of England, but may be accounted
for by the peculiar circumstances of the island.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, Beda estimates Thanet at 600 hides<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c008'><sup>[167]</sup></a>.
Now Thanet, at this day, contains 23,000 acres of
arable land, and 3500 of marsh and pastures. The
latter must have been far more extensive in the
time of Beda, for in the first place there must have
been some land on the side of Surrey and Sussex
reserved as Mark, and we know that drainage and
natural causes have reclaimed considerable tracts
in that part of Kent<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c008'><sup>[168]</sup></a>; nor is it reasonable to suppose
that our forefathers ploughed up as much
land as we do. Yet even 23,000 acres will give us
only 38⅓ acres to the hide; and I do not think we
shall be venturing too much in placing the 3200,
3800 or 5000 acres by which 23,000 respectively
exceed 19,800, 19,200 and 18,000, to the account
of pastures and commons. Seven or eight thousand
acres of common land would bear in fact so
unusually small a proportion to the quantity under
crop, that we should be disposed to suspect the
islanders of having been less wealthy than many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of their neighbours, unless we give them credit
for having sacrificed bread crops to the far more
remunerative pasturage of cattle<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c008'><sup>[169]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole acreage of Kent is 972,240 acres.
What amount of this must be deducted for waste,
rivers, roads and towns I cannot say, but some deduction
is necessary. Now Kent numbered 15,000
hides: this gives a quotient of 64 to 65 acres per
hide; and at the least, one half of this may fairly
be taken off for marsh, pasture and the weald of
Andred.</p>

<p class='c001'>The calculation for Sussex is rendered uncertain
in some measure, through our ignorance of the relative
proportion borne by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>weald</i></span> in the seventh
century or earlier, to its present extent. The whole
county is computed at 907,920 acres, and the weald
at 425,000 acres. We may be assured that every
foot of the weald was forest in the time of Beda:
to this must be added 110,000 acres which are
still waste and totally unfit for the plough: 30,000
acres now computed to be occupied by roads, buildings,
etc. may be neglected: our amount will therefore
state itself thus:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Now Sussex contained 7000 hides<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c008'><sup>[170]</sup></a>, and this will
give us a quotient of 53·25 acres per hide. Here
again, if we make allowance for the condition of
Saxon husbandry, we shall hardly err much in assuming
something near thirty to thirty-three acres
to have been the arable hide in Sussex.</p>

<p class='c001'>When once we leave the accurate reports of a
historian like Beda for the evidence of later manuscripts,
we must necessarily proceed with great
caution, and in reasonable distrust of our conclusions.
This must be borne in mind and fairly appreciated
throughout the following calculations.</p>

<p class='c001'>An authority already mentioned<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c008'><sup>[171]</sup></a> computes the
number of hides in Eastanglia at 30,000. It is
difficult to determine exactly what counties are
meant by this, as we do not know the date of the
document; but supposing, what is most probable,
that Norfolk and Suffolk are intended, we should
have a total of 2,241,060 acres in those two great
farming districts<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c008'><sup>[172]</sup></a>. But even this large amount
will only give us a quotient of 73·7 acres per hide,
and it may fairly be diminished by at least one
half, to account for commons, marshes, forests and
other land not brought under the plough from the
seventh to the tenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same table states Essex at 7000 hides. The
acreage of that county is 979,000 acres<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c008'><sup>[173]</sup></a>, hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>upon the whole calculation we shall have 139<sup>6</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub> acres
per hide. But of course here a very great deduction
is to be made for Epping, Hainault and other
forests, and for marshy and undrained land.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall now proceed to reverse the order of proceeding
which has hitherto been adopted, and to
show that the hypothesis of the hide having comprised
from thirty to thirty-three acres is the only
one which will answer the conditions found in various
grants: that in a number of cases from very
different parts of England, a larger number of acres
would either be impossible or most improbable:
that it is entirely impossible for the hide to have
reached 120 or even 100 acres, and that the amount
left after deducting the arable, to form pastures
and meadows, is by no means extravagant. The
examples are taken from different charters printed
in the Codex Diplomaticus Ævi Saxonici, and for
convenience of reference are arranged tabularly.
The comparison is made with the known acreage,
taken from the Parliamentary return of 1841<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c008'><sup>[174]</sup></a>.
The table is constructed upon the following plan.
The first column contains the name of the place;
the second, the number of hides; the third, the
actual acreage; the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth, the hides calculated at thirty, thirty-two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>thirty-three, forty and one hundred acres respectively;
the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth, the
excess of real over supposed acreage, at the first four
amounts; the thirteenth, the excess of hidage over
real acreage on the hypothesis of one hundred acres
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>per hide; the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and
seventeenth, the ratios of hidage at thirty, thirty-two,
thirty-three and forty, to the excess, from
which we deduce the proportion between the arable,
and the meadow, pasture and waste. In a few instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>there is a double return, implying that it is
uncertain to which, of two synonymous districts,
a grant must be referred.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have thus forty-nine cases in which the
Hide is proved less than 100 acres, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> less
than 120. Any one who carefully considers the
ratios arrived at in the foregoing table, which for
any one of the assumed cases rarely exceed <em>one to
two</em>, will agree that there is a remarkable coincidence
in the results, in at least the rich, fertile and
cultivated counties from which the examples are
derived. In some cases indeed the proportion of
arable to waste is so great, that we must suppose
other districts, now under cultivation, to have been
then entirely untouched, in order to conceive sufficient
space for marks and pastures. But lest it
should be objected that these examples can teach
us only what was the case in fertile districts, I subjoin
a calculation of the Hidage and Acreage of
all England, including all its barren moors, its forests,
its marshes and its meadows, from the Solent
to the utmost limit of Northumberland.</p>

<p class='c018'>This calculation leaves no doubt a bare possibility
of the hide’s containing 100 or 120 statute-acres:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>but those who are inclined to believe that, taking
all England through, the proportion of cultivated to
uncultivated land was as 29:3, or even as 24:7, it
must be owned, appreciate our ancient husbandry
beyond its merits<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c008'><sup>[175]</sup></a>. Cultivation may very probably
have increased with great rapidity up to the
commencement of the ninth century; and in that
case, waste land would have been brought under
the plough to meet the demands of increasing population:
but the savage inroads of the Northmen
which filled the next succeeding century must have
had a strong tendency in the opposite direction. I
can hardly believe that a third of all England was
under cultivation at the time of the conquest; yet
this is the result which we obtain from a calculation
of thirty-two or thirty-three acres to the hide,
while a calculation of forty acres gives us a result
of three-eighths, or very little less than one-half.
The extraordinary character of this result will best
appear from the following considerations.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we proceed to apply these calculations to the
existing condition of England, we shall be still more
clearly satisfied that from thirty to thirty-three acres
is at any rate a near approximation to the truth.

giving a ratio of rather less than 15:11 between
the cultivated and uncultivated: how much
of this is arable and garden I cannot exactly determine;
but it is probable that a great deal is reckoned
to profitable cultivation, which could not have

cultivated or artificial grassland, and brushwood,
are all sources of profit, and thus are properly

be tithed or taxed as productive: but they are not
strictly what the hide was, and must be deducted
in any calculation such as that which is the object

with inconsistent amounts by different authorities,
where the difference rests upon what is
reckoned to profitable cultivation, on which subject

<p class='c001'>Thus of the whole productive surface of the
Austrian empire, the <em>arable</em> bears only the proportion
of 4:11. But to this must clearly be added
an immense extent of land totally unfitted for the
plough; by which the ratio of arable to the whole
territorial surface will be materially diminished.
Strange then as the conclusion may appear, we are
compelled to admit that England at the close of the
tenth century had advanced to a high pitch of cultivation:
while the <a id='corr112.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='impossiblity'>impossibility</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_112.12'><ins class='correction' title='impossiblity'>impossibility</ins></a></span> of reckoning the
hide at much above thirty Saxon acres is demonstrated.
It is clear, however the property of the
land may have been distributed, that the elements
of wealth existed in no common degree<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c008'><sup>[178]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The number of forty acres has of course been
taken solely for the purpose of getting a common
measure with the present acre assumed in the parliamentary
survey. Whether it corresponded exactly
with thirty, thirty-two or thirty-three Saxon acres,
it is impossible to say, but I have shown that the
difference could not be very great. Something may
be alleged in favour of each of these numbers; but
on the whole the larger one of thirty-three acres
seems to me the most probable. A valuable entry
of the year 967 may help us to some clearer conclusion<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c008'><sup>[179]</sup></a>.
In this document Bishop Oswald states
himself to have made a grant of seó þridde hind
at Dydinccotan, ðæt is, se þridde æcer,—the third
<em>hind</em> at Didcot, that is, the third acre. It is certain
that at some very early period the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hund</i></span>
denoted <em>ten</em>, whence we explain its occurrence in
such numerals as hundseofontig, hundeahtatig, etc.
The word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hind</i></span> then, I derive from this hund, and
render by <em>tenth</em>, and the grant seems to have conveyed
the third <em>tenth</em>, which can only be said of a
quantity containing three times ten units of some
description or other. But this third tenth is further
described as being every third acre, that is, a
third of the whole land; and ten units make up
this third: it seems therefore not unreasonable to
suppose that the acre was the unit in question, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>ten such acres constituted the hind, and that the
hind itself was the third part of the hide. When
we consider that thirty acres are exactly three
times an area of 40 × 40 square rods, there appears
a probability that the measure was calculated upon
a threefold course of cultivation, similar to that in
use upon the continent of Europe; this consisted
of a rotation of winter corn, summer corn, and
fallow, and to each a block or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>telga</i></span> of ten large or
forty small acres (roods) was allotted. Thirty acres
were thus devoted to cultivation; but where was
the homestall? Probably not upon the thirty acres
themselves, which we cannot suppose to have been
generally enclosed and sundered, but to have lain
undivided, as far as external marks were concerned,
<em>in the general arable of the community</em>. The village
containing the homesteads of the markers, probably
lay at a little distance from the fields<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c008'><sup>[180]</sup></a>, and I do
not think we shall be giving too much when we
allow three acres, over and above the thirty, for
farm buildings, strawyard and dwelling. For we
cannot doubt that stall-feeding was the rule with
regard to horned cattle in general. In the same
dialogue which has been already cited, the ploughman
is made to say: “I must fill the oxen’s cribs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>with hay, and give them water, and bear out their
dung<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c008'><sup>[181]</sup></a>.” Moreover there must be room found for
stacks of hay and wood, for barns and outhouses,
and sleeping-rooms both for the serfs and the members
of the family; nor are houses of more than
one story very likely to have been built<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c008'><sup>[182]</sup></a>. With
this introduction I proceed to another grant of
Oswald<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c008'><sup>[183]</sup></a>. In the year 996, he gave three hides of
land to Eádríc: the property however lay in different
places: <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">“æt Eánulfestúne óðerhealf híd, ⁊ æt
úferan Strætforda, on ðǽre gesyndredan híde, ðone
óðerne æcer, ⁊ æt Fachanleáge ðone þriddan æcer
feldlandes ... ⁊ on eásthealfe Afene eahta æceras
mǽdwa, ⁊ forne gean Biccenclife. xii. æceras mǽdwa,
⁊ þreo æcras benorðan Afene tó myllnstealle;”</span>
i. e. “at Eanulfestun a hide and a half; at upper
Stratford the second acre (i. e. half a hide); at Fachanleah
the third acre (i. e. a third of a hide); on
the east of the river Avon, eight acres of meadow,
and onwards towards Biccancliff, twelve acres; and
to the northward of the Avon, the three acres for
a millstall.” Our data here are 1½ hide + ½ hide
+ ⅓ hide, or 2⅓ hides; but, if the calculations which
precede are correct, 8 + 12 acres or 20 acres = ⅔
hide, and thus make up three hides of thirty acres
each: three acres devoted to mill-buildings are not
reckoned into the sum, and it is therefore possible
that a similar course was pursued with regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to the land occupied, not by the millstall but by
the homestall<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c008'><sup>[184]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having thus stated my own view of the approximate
value of the hide, I feel it right to cite one or
two passages which seem adverse to it. By a grant
of the year 977, Oswald conveyed to Æðelwald,
two hides, all but sixty acres; these sixty acres the
bishop had taken into his own demesne or inland
at Kempsey, as wheat-land<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c008'><sup>[185]</sup></a>. Now if this be an accurate
reading, and not by chance an ill-copied lx
for ix, it would seem to imply that sixty acres were
less than a hide; for these acres were clearly arable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, Æðelred granted land at Stoke to Léofríc
in 982: the estate conveyed was of three hides and
thirty acres, called in one charter <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jugera</i></span>, in another
part of the same grant, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>æcera</i></span><a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c008'><sup>[186]</sup></a>. It may be argued
that here the acres were meadow or pasture, not
included in the arable. But there are other calculations
upon the jugerum<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c008'><sup>[187]</sup></a>, which render it probable
that less than our statute-acre was intended by the
term. For example, in 839, king Æðelwulf gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Dudda ten <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>jugera</i></span> within the walls of Canterbury:
now Canterbury at this day comprises only 3240
acres, and taking the area of almost any provincial
town, it seems hardly probable that ten full acres
within the walls should have been granted to any
person, especially to one who, like Dudda, was of
no very great consideration. A town-lot of two
acres and a half, or ten roods, is conceivable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last example to be quoted is from a will of
Ælfgár<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c008'><sup>[188]</sup></a>, a king’s thane, about 958. In this, among
other legacies, he grants to Æðelgár a hide of
120 acres: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">and ic Æðelgár an án híde lond ðes
ðe Æðulf hauede be hundtuelti acren, áteo só he
wille.</span>” In this instance I am inclined to think that
the special description implies a difference from the
usual computation: if a hide were <em>always</em> 120 acres,
why should Ælfgár think it necessary to particularize
this one hide? was there a large hide of
120, as well as a small one of thirty? In the other
cases—looking at the impossibility of assigning
more than forty statute-acres to the Saxon hide,
so plainly demonstrated by the tables—I suppose
the æcras to be small acres or roods.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is scarcely necessary to say that where the
number of hides mentioned in any place falls very
far short of the actual acreage, no argument can
be derived any way. The utmost it proves is that
only a certain amount, however inconsiderable, was
under the plough. Thus Beda tells us that Anglesey
contained 960, Iona or Icolmkill, only five,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>hides<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c008'><sup>[189]</sup></a>. The acreage of Anglesey gives 150,000
acres under cultivation: this would be 156·33 per
hide; but in this island a very great reduction is
necessary: taking it even as it stands, and calculating
the hide at thirty acres, we should have a
ratio of 24:101; at forty acres, a ratio of 32:93
or little more than 1:3.</p>

<p class='c001'>Iona numbers about 1300 acres (nearly two square
miles): this at five hides would give 260 acres per
hide: at thirty acres, a ratio of 3:23 or nearly
1:8 between cultivated and uncultivated land: or
at forty acres, a ratio of 2:11. But the monks and
their dependants were the only inhabitants; and in
the time of Beda, up to which there is no proof of
the land’s having been inhabited at all (in fact it
was selected expressly because a <em>desert</em>), sand, if
not forest, must have occupied a large proportion
of the surface.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us now retrace our steps for a few moments.
The hide was calculated upon the arable: it was
the measure of the alod,—the éðel, or inherited,
individual possession; it was the κλῆρος, lot, or
share of the first settler: it kept a plough at work
during the year: and, according to its etymology
(<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>higid</i></span>) and the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>familia</i></span> by which it was translated,
it was to suffice for the support of one Hiwisc
or household.</p>

<p class='c001'>Did it really so suffice, at first and afterwards?
Unquestionably it did. We may safely assert this,
without entering into nice speculations as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>amount of population in the Saxon kingdoms of the
seventh, eighth, ninth, or even eleventh centuries.
We know that in the eighth century, 150 hides were
enough for the support and comfort of 600 monks
in Yarrow and Wearmouth<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c008'><sup>[190]</sup></a>; there is no reason,
from their history, to suppose that they were at all
sparingly provided for. But allowance must be
made also for serfs and dependants, the exercise of
hospitality and charity, the occasional purchase of
books, vestments and decorations, the collection of
reliques, and the maintenance of the fabric both of
the church and monastery. Grants and presents,
offerings and foundations would do much, but still
some portion of these necessary expenses must be
carried to the account of the general fund. At this
rate however, one hide was capable of maintaining
four full-grown men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now even at the present day an industrious man
can very well support his family upon, not thirty
or forty, but ten acres of average land<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c008'><sup>[191]</sup></a>. If we look
at the produce of such a threefold course as has
been mentioned, there can hardly be any doubt
upon the subject; the cultivator would have every
year twenty Saxon (= 26⅔ Norman) acres under
some kind of corn, principally barley in all probability,
though much wheat was grown. Assuming
the yield at only two quarters per acre, which is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>almost ludicrous understatement of the probable
amount<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c008'><sup>[192]</sup></a>, we give each householder forty quarters
of cereals, at the very lowest, and deducting his
seed-corn and the public taxes, we still leave him a
very large amount. The average annual consumption
of wheat per head in England is now computed
at one quarter: let us add one half to compensate
for the less nutritious qualities of barley, and we
shall yet be under the mark if we allow our householder
at the close of the year, a net receipt of thirty
quarters, or food for at least twenty persons. Add
to this the cattle, and especially swine fed in the
forests,—which paid well for their own keep, and
gave a net surplus—and the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ceorl</i></span> or owner of one
hide of land, independently of his political rights,
becomes a person of some consideration from his
property<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c008'><sup>[193]</sup></a>: in short he is fully able to maintain
himself, his wife and child, the ox that ploughs,
and the slave that tends his land,—owning much
more indeed, than, in Hesiod’s eyes, would have
sufficed for these purposes<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c008'><sup>[194]</sup></a>. It may be admitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>that the skies of Greece and Italy showered kindlier
rays upon the Ionian or the Latin than visited
the rough denizen of our Thule; that less food of
any kind, and especially less meat, was required for
their support<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c008'><sup>[195]</sup></a>, and that they felt no necessity to
withdraw large amounts of barley from the annual
yield, for the purpose of producing fermented
liquors<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c008'><sup>[196]</sup></a>; still, as far as the amount of land is concerned,
the advantage is incontestably on the side
of the Anglosaxon; and in this one element of
wealth, our ceorl was comparatively richer than the
comrade of Romulus or the worshipper of Athene.</p>

“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anglorum sive Saxonum gens.</span>” He draws no distinction between
Angle and Saxon tribes, except where special reasons lead him to particularize
them. He does note discrepancies between them, which
would have appeared far less important to a scientific and mathematical
thinker, as he was, than differences in land-divisions. I conclude then
that no limitation can be admitted in his assertion, and that the words
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">iuxta mensuram Anglorum</span>” denote, “according to the admeasurement

<div class='footnote' id='f157'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r157'>157</a>. That it was a fixed and not a variable quantity, both as to form

<p class='c001'><a href='#r161'>161</a>. This seems clear from a comparison of two passages already quoted
in a note, but which must here be given more at length. The law of
Æðelstán defines the king’s peace as extending from his door to the
distance on every side of three miles, three <em>furlongs</em>, three acres’
breadth, nine feet, nine palms, and nine barleycorns. The law of
Henry gives the measurements thus: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tria miliaria, et tres <em>quarantenae</em>,
et ix (? iii) acrae latitudine, et ix pedes et ix palmae, et ix grana ordei.</span>”
Thus the furlang and quarantena are identified. But it is also clear
that the series is a descending one, and consequently that the furlang
or quarantena is longer than the breadth of an acre. If, as is probable,
it is derived from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quarante</i></span>, I should suppose three lengths and three
breadths of an acre to have been intended; in fact that some multiple
of forty was the longer side of the acre.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER V. <br /> PERSONAL RANK. THE FREEMAN. THE NOBLE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second principle laid down in the first chapter
of this book, is that of personal rank, which in the
Teutonic scheme appears inseparably connected
with the possession of land.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest records we can refer to, place before
us a system founded upon distinctions of birth, as
clearly as any that we can derive from the Parliamentary
writs or rolls of later ages: in our history
there is not even a fabulous Arcadia, wherein we
may settle a free democracy: for even where the
records of fact no longer supply a clue through the
labyrinths of our early story, the epic continues the
tradition, and still celebrates the deeds of nobles
and of kings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tacitus, from whom we derive our earliest information,
supplies us with many details, which not
only show the existence of a system, but tend also
to prove its long prevalence. He tells us not only
of nobles, but also of kings, princes and inherited
authority<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c008'><sup>[197]</sup></a>, more or less fully developed: and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>unbiassed judgment of the statesman who witnessed
the operation of institutions strange to himself,
warns us against theoretical appeals to the fancied
customs of ages not contemporaneous with our
own. The history of Europe knows nothing of a
period in which there were not freemen, nobles and
serfs; and the institutions of Europe, in proportion
as we pursue them to their earliest principles, furnish
only the stronger confirmation of history. We
may, no doubt, theorize upon this subject, and
suggest elementary forms, as the necessary conditions
of a later system: but this process is and
must be merely hypothetical, nor can such forms
be shown to have had at any time a true historical
existence. That every German was, in the beginning,
Kaiser and Pope in his own house<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c008'><sup>[198]</sup></a> may be
perfectly true in one sense; just as true is it that
every Englishman’s house is his castle. Nevertheless,
the German lived under some government,
civil or religious, or both: and—to the great advantage
of society—the process of law surmounts
without the slightest difficulty the imaginary battlements
of the imaginary fortress.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole subject must be considered in one of
two ways: with reference, namely, to a man living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>alone with his family, or to the same man and
family, in a bond of union with others, that is in
the <em>state</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Could we conceive a permanent condition of
society, such that each particular family lived
apart, without connection or communion with
others, we must admit the inevitable growth of a
patriarchal system, of which the eldest member of
the family would be the head; a system similar to
that which we do find described as prevailing in
the wandering family of Abraham. But such a
condition could only exist at a period of time, and
in a state of the earth, which admitted of frequent
migration, and while the population bore a small
proportion to the means of support, perhaps even
in countries where water is of greater value than
land. Thus the moment the family of Abraham
became too numerous, and his herdsmen found it
necessary to defend their wells and pastures against
the herdsmen of Lot, a separation took place and
the Scheiks parted, according to the provisions of
a solemn compact, that there might not be strife
between them<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c008'><sup>[199]</sup></a>. But, setting aside the mysterious
purposes for which the race of Abraham were made
wanderers, and which impress an exceptional character
upon their whole history, it is clear that
even they were surrounded by a society, whose conditions
were totally different from any that could
have existed in Germany. They fled from the face
of a depraved cultivation, prevalent in the cities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and they were sojourners only from place to place,
till the fulness of time, when they were to found
the normal theocracy of the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>To a certain degree they resembled the squatters
in the backwoods of America; like them, they established
a law for themselves, and acted upon it:—with
the nature of that law, divine or human, we
have nothing to do, for the purposes of this inquiry:—in
this sense, indeed, they could be kings
and priests in their own house; but so are, or were,
the North American <em>Regulators</em>, who, in their own
families and among all over whom they could establish
their power, acted as judges, and both promulgated
and executed a law which was necessary
to their very existence in the <a id='corr124.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='widerness'>wilderness</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_124.15'><ins class='correction' title='widerness'>wilderness</ins></a></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I find it impossible to admit that the origin
of our Germanic nations is to be found in any such
solitary households or families; were it true, as
Möser appears to argue<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c008'><sup>[200]</sup></a>, of some parts of Westphalia,
it would not be so of other districts in
southern Germany, as he indeed admits<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c008'><sup>[201]</sup></a>, and,
particularly, it would not be true of England. In
these two cases there can be no doubt that some
kind of military organization preceded the peaceful
settlement, and in many respects determined
its mode and character<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c008'><sup>[202]</sup></a>. But, even if we admit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to the fullest extent, the doctrine of solitary settlements,
we must still contend that these are, in
their very nature, temporary; that they contain
no possible provision for stability, in short that
they are excluded by the very idea itself of a state;
yet it is as a member of a state that man exists,
that he is intended to exist<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c008'><sup>[203]</sup></a>, and unless as a member
of a state, he is incapable of existing as a man.
He can as little create a language as create a state:
he is born to both, for both, and without both he
cannot exist at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Each single family then is a state: two, three or
four families are a state, under larger conditions.
How are these last to be settled?</p>

<p class='c001'>Where a number of independent households are
thinly dispersed over a portion of the country, their
reciprocal relations and position will probably be
more or less of the following kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some arrangement will exist for the regulation
of the terms on which the use of the woods, waters
and common uncultivated land may be enjoyed by
all the settlers: it is even possible that they may
have some common religious ceremonies as the
basis of this arrangement<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c008'><sup>[204]</sup></a>. But further than this
there need be no union or mutual dependence;
each solitary homestead is a state by itself, possessing
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jus belli</i></span>; in no federal relation to,
and consequently in a state of war with, every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>other household, even though this right of war
should not be in active operation at any given
moment<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c008'><sup>[205]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In his own household every man may bear rule,
either following his own arbitrary will, or in accordance
with certain general principles, which he probably
recognizes in common with his neighbours.
He may have a family worship of his own, of which
he will be the chief priest<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c008'><sup>[206]</sup></a>, and which worship may
or may not be consistent with that of his neighbours.
If he is troublesome to them, they may root him
out, slay or enslave him, do with him what seems
good in their eyes, or whatsoever they have power
to do. If he thrives and accumulates wealth, they
may despoil him, or he oppress them,—all, however,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jure belli</i></span>, for there can be no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jus imperii</i></span> in
such a case.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, however, cannot be the normal state of
man. The anxious desire, it might almost be called
instinctive yearning, to form a part of a civilized
society, forbids its continuance, not less than the
obvious advantage of entering into a mutual guarantee
of peace and security. The production of
food and other necessaries of life is the first business
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of men: the attempt to take forcible possession
of, or to defend, accumulated property, presupposes
the accumulation. While the land and water are
more than sufficient for the support of the population,
the institutions proper to peace will prevail.
It is inconceivable, and repugnant to the very
nature of man, that such institutions should not be
established the moment that two or more separate
families become conscious of each other’s existence<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c008'><sup>[207]</sup></a>:
and in respect to our Germanic forefathers, we find
such in full vigour from their very first appearance
in history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of the institutions essential to the great
aim of establishing civil society at the least possible
sacrifice of individual freedom—such as the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wergild</i></span>,
the <em>Frank pledge</em>, etc.—will be investigated in
their proper places: they seem to offer a nearly
perfect guarantee for society at an early period.
But for the present we must confine ourselves to
the subject of personal rank: and as the centre and
groundwork of the whole Teutonic scheme is the
individual freeman, it is with him that we must
commence our investigation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The natural divisions into which all human society
must be distributed, with respect to the beings
that form it, are the <em>Free</em> and the <em>Unfree</em><a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c008'><sup>[208]</sup></a>, those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>who can protect themselves and those who must
be in the protection of others. Even in the family
this distinction must be found, and the wife and
son are unfree in relation to the husband and
the father; they are in his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mund</i></span>. From this mund
the son indeed may be emancipated, but not the
wife or daughter: these can only change it; the
wife by the act of God, namely the death of the
husband; the daughter by marriage. In both cases
the mund passes over into other hands<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c008'><sup>[209]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Originally the Freeman is he who possesses at
least as much land as, being tilled, will feed him,
strength and skill to labour, and arms to defend
his possession. Married to one free woman who
shares his toils, soothes his cares, and orders his
household, he becomes the founder of the family—the
first unit in the state: the son who springs
from this marriage, completes the family, and
centres in himself the blood, the civil rights and
the affections of his two progenitors. It is thus,
through the son, that the family becomes the foundation
of the state<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c008'><sup>[210]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The union of a greater or less number of free
heads of houses upon a district sufficient for their
support, in a mutual guarantee of equal civil rights,
is the state itself: for man is evidently formed by
God to live in a regulated community, by which
mode of life alone he can develope the highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>qualities of the nature which God has implanted in
him; and the first community is the union of free
men for purposes of friendly intercourse and mutual
aid, each enjoying at the hands of every other the
same rights as he is willing to grant to every other,
each yielding something of his natural freedom in
order that the idea of state, that is of orderly government,
may be realized. For the state is necessary,
not accidental. Man not living in a state,
not having developed and in some degree realized
the idea of state, is, in so far, not man but beast.
He has no past and no future: he lives for the
day, and does not even accumulate for the days to
come: he lives, thinks, feels and dies like a brute.
For man is free through the existence, not the absence,
of law; through his voluntary and self-conscious
relinquishment of the power to do wrong,
and the adoption of means to counteract and diminish
his own tendency to evil. The amount of
personal liberty to be given up is the only question
of practical importance, but from the idea of Freedom
itself results the law, that this amount must
be in all cases a minimum.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ideas of freedom and equality are not, however,
inseparable: a nation of slaves may exist in
sorrowful equality under the capricious will of a
native or foreign tyrant: a nation of free men may
cheerfully, wisely and happily obey the judge or the
captain they have elected in the exigencies of peace
and war. Hence the voluntary union of free men
does not exclude the possibility of such union being
either originally based upon terms of inequality, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>becoming sooner or later settled upon such a basis.
But, as the general term is the freedom, I take this as
the unity which involves the difference; the noble
is one of the freemen, and is made noble by the act
of the free: the free are not made so by the noble.</p>

<p class='c001'>By these principles the divisions of this chapter
are regulated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The freeman is emphatically called Man, ceorl,
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mas</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>maritus</i></span>; wæpned man, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>armatus</i></span>; after the prevalence
of slavery, he is, for distinction, termed
<em>free</em>, frigman, frihals, i. e., <em>free neck</em>, the hand of a
master has not bent his neck<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c008'><sup>[211]</sup></a>; but his oldest and
purest denomination is ceorl. Till a very late period
the Anglosaxon law knows no other distinction
than that of ceorl and eorl<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c008'><sup>[212]</sup></a>. The Old Norse Rígsmál
which is devoted to the origin of the races,
considers Karl as the representative of the freeman.
His sons are Halr, Anglosaxon, Hæle, <i>vir</i>; Drengr,
Anglos. Dreng, <i>vir</i>; þegen, Anglos. þegn, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vir fortis</i></span>,
<em>miles</em>, <em>minister</em>; Höldr, Anglos. hold, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pugil</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fidelis</i></span>;
Búi, Anglos. gebúr, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>colonus</i></span>; Bondi, Anglos. bonda,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>colonus</i></span>; Smiðr, Anglos. Smið, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>faber</i></span>; Seggr, Anglos.
Secg, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vir</i></span>. Among the daughters are Snót, Brúðr,
Flioð and Wíf. Many of these terms yet survive,
to represent various classes of freemen in almost
every Germanic country<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c008'><sup>[213]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The rights of a freeman are these. He has land
within the limits of the community, the éðel or
hereditary estate (κληρος, hæredium, hýd) by virtue
of which he is a portion of the community, bound
to various duties and graced with his various privileges.
For although his rights are personal, inherent
in himself, and he may carry them with him
into the wilderness if he please, still, where he shall
be permitted to execute them depends upon his
possession of lands in the various localities. In
these he is entitled to vote with his fellows upon
all matters concerning the general interests of the
community; the election of a judge, general or
king; the maintenance of peace or war with a
neighbouring community; the abrogation of old, or
the introduction of new laws; the admission of conterminous
freemen to a participation of rights and
privileges in the district. He is not only entitled
but bound to share in the celebration of the public
rites of religion, to assist at the public council or
Ðing, where he is to pronounce the customary law,
by ancient right, and so assist in judging between
man and man; lastly to take part, as a soldier, in
such measures of offence and defence as have been
determined upon by the whole community. He is
at liberty to make his own alliances, to unite with
other freemen in the formation of gilds or associations
for religious or political purposes. He can
even attach himself, if he will, to a lord or patron,
and thus withdraw himself from the duties and
the privileges of freedom. He and his family may
depart whither he will, and no man may follow or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>prevent him: but he must go by open day and publicly,
(probably not without befitting ceremonies
and a symbolical renunciation of his old seats,) that
all may have their claims upon him settled before
he departs<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c008'><sup>[214]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The freeman must possess, and may bear arms;
he is born to them, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>schildbürtig</i></span>; he wears them on
all occasions, public and private, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil neque publicae
neque privatae rei nisi armati agunt</span><a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c008'><sup>[215]</sup></a>;” he is
entitled to use them for the defence of his life and
honour; for he possesses the right of private warfare,
and either alone, or with the aid of his friends,
may fight, if it seems good to him. This right is
technically named <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fǽðe</span>, <em>feud</em>, from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fá</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inimicus</i></span>;

feud</em><a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c008'><sup>[216]</sup></a>. If he be strong enough, or ill-disposed
enough, to prefer a violent to a peaceful settlement
of his claims, he may attack, imprison and even
slay his adversary, but then he must bear the feud
of the relations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beside the arms he wears, the sign and ornament
of his freedom is the long hair which he suffers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to float upon his shoulders or winds about his
head<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c008'><sup>[217]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>His proper measure and value, by which his
social position is ascertained and defended, is the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, or <em>price of a man</em>. His life, his limbs,
the injuries which may be done to himself, his dependants
and his property, are all duly assessed;
and though not rated so highly as the noble, yet he
stands above the stranger, the serf or the freedman.
In like manner his land, though not entirely exempt
from charges and payments for public purposes,
is far less burthened than the land of the unfree.
Moreover he possesses rights in the commons,
woods and waters, which the unfree were assuredly
not permitted to exercise.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great and essential distinction, however,
which he never entirely loses under any circumstances,
is that he aids in governing himself, that
is in making, applying and executing the laws by
which the free and the unfree are alike governed;
that he yields, in short, a voluntary obedience to
the law, for the sake of living under a law, in an
orderly and peaceful community.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the state of things which we are now considering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the noble belongs to the class of freemen;
out of it he springs, in all its rights and privileges
he shares, to all its duties he is liable, but in a
different degree. He possesses however certain
advantages which the freeman does not. Like the
latter he is a holder of real estate; he owns land in
the district, but his lot is probably larger, and is
moreover free from various burthens which press
upon his less fortunate neighbour. He must also
take part in the Ðing, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>placitum</i></span>, or general meeting,
but he and his class have the leading and directing
of the public business, and ultimately the execution
of the general will<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c008'><sup>[218]</sup></a>. The people at large may elect,
but he alone can be elected, to the offices of priest,
judge or king. Upon his life and dignity a higher
price is laid than upon those of the mere freeman.
He is the unity in the mass, the representative of
the general sovereignty, both at home and abroad.
The tendency of his power is continually to increase,
while that of the mere freeman is continually
to diminish, falling in the scale in exact proportion
as that of the noble class rises.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> THE KING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the noble is to the freeman, so in some respects
is the King to the noble. He is the summit of his
class, and completes the order of the freemen. Even
in the dim twilight of Teutonic history we find
tribes and nations subject to kings: others again
acknowledged no such office, and Tacitus seems to
regard this state as the more natural to our forefathers.
I do not think this clear: on the contrary,
kingship, in a certain sense, seems to me
rooted in the German mind and institutions, and
universal among some particular tribes and confederacies.
The free people recognize in the King
as much of the national unity as they consider
necessary to their existence as a substantive body,
and as the representative of the whole nation they
consider him to be a mediator between themselves
and the gods<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c008'><sup>[220]</sup></a>. The elective principle is the safeguard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of their freedom; the monarchical principle
is the condition of their nationality. But this idea
of kingship is not that which we now generally entertain;
it is in some respects more, in others less,
comprehensive.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here it seems necessary to recur to a definition
of words. With us, a king is the source both
of the military and the judicial powers; he is chief
judge and general in chief; among protestants he
is head of the church, and only wants the functions
of high priest, because the nature of the church
of Christ admits of no priestly body exclusively
engaged in the sacrifices, or in possession of the
exclusive secrets, of the cult<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c008'><sup>[221]</sup></a>. But in the eye of the
state, and as the head of a state clergy, he is the
high priest, the authority in which ultimately even
the parochial order centres and finds its completion.
He is an officer of the state; the highest
indeed and the noblest, but to the state he belongs
as a part of itself: with us a commission of regency,
a stranger or a woman may perform all the functions
of royalty; the houses of parliament may
limit them; a successful soldier may usurp them.
With the early Germans, the king was something
different from this.</p>

<p class='c001'>The inhabitants of the Mark or Gá, however numerous
or however few they may be, must always
have some provision for the exigencies of peace
and war. But peace is the natural or normal state,
that for which war itself exists, and the institutions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>proper to war are the exception, not the rule.
Hence the priestly and judicial functions are permanent,—the
military, merely temporary. The former,
whether united in the same person, or divided
between two or more, are the necessary conditions
of the existence of the state as a community; the
latter are merely requisite from time to time, to
secure the free exertion of the former, to defend
the existence of the community against the attacks
of other communities.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may admit that the father is the first priest
and judge in his own household; he has, above all
other, the sacerdotal secrets, and the peculiar rites,
of family worship; these, not less than age, experience
and the dignity of paternity, are the causes
and the justification of his power. The judicial
is a corollary from the sacerdotal authority. But
what applies to the individual household applies to
any aggregate of households: even as the family
worship and the family peace require the exertion
of these powers for their own maintenance and
preservation, so do the public worship and the
public peace require their existence, though in a
yet stronger degree. From among the heads of
families some one or more must be elected to discharge
the all-important functions which they imply.
If the solemn festivals and public rites of the
god are to be duly celebrated, if the anger of the
thunderer is to be propitiated, and the fruits of the
earth to be blessed,—if the wounded cattle are to be
healed, the fever expelled, or the secret malice of
evil spirits to be defeated,—who but the priest can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>lead the ceremonies and prescribe the ritual? Who
but he can sanctify the transfer of land, the union
of man and wife, the entrance of the newborn child
upon his career of life; who but himself can conduct
judicial investigations, where the deities are
the only guardians of truth and avengers of perjury,
or where their supernatural power alone can determine
between innocence and guilt<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c008'><sup>[222]</sup></a>? Lastly, who
but he can possess authority to punish the freeman
for offences dangerous to the wellbeing of all freemen?
To what power less than that of God will
the freeman condescend to bow<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c008'><sup>[223]</sup></a>?</p>

<p class='c001'>How then is it to be determined to whom such
power, once admitted to be necessary, shall be at
first entrusted? The first claim clearly lies with
those who are believed to be descended from the
gods, or from the local god of each particular district<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c008'><sup>[224]</sup></a>.
They are his especial care, his children;
he led them into the land, and gave them the secret
of appeasing or pleasing him: he protects them by
his power, and guides them by his revelations: he
is their family and household god, the progenitor
of their race, one of themselves; and they are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>best, indeed the only, expounders of his will. A
single family, with which others have by slow degrees
united themselves, by which others have been
adopted, and which in process of time have thus
become the nucleus of a state, will probably remain
in possession of this sacerdotal power; the god of
the land does not readily give place to others, and
those with whom his worship identifies him will
continue to be his priests long after others have
joined in their ceremonies. Or it is possible that
a single household wandering from a more civilized
community may be admitted among a rude people,
to whom they impart more perfect methods of tillage,
more efficient medical precepts, more impartial
maxims of law, better or more ornamental
modes of architecture, or more accurate computations
of time, than they had previously possessed:
the mysterious courses of the stars, the secrets of
building bridges<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c008'><sup>[225]</sup></a>, towers and ships, of ploughing
and of sowing, of music and of healing, have been
committed to them by their god: for the sake of
the benefits they offer, their god is received into
the community; and they remain his priests because
they alone are cognizant of, and can conduct,
the rites wherewith he is to be served.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even in periods so remote as not to be confounded
with those of national migrations, a small
body of superior personal strength, physical beauty,
mental organization, or greater skill in arms, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>establish a preponderance over a more numerous
but less favoured race: in such a case they will
probably join the whole mass of the people, receiving
or taking lands among them, and they will
by right of their superiority constitute a noble,
sacerdotal, royal race, among a race of freemen<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c008'><sup>[226]</sup></a>.
They may introduce their religion as well as their
form of government, as did the Dorians in the Peloponesus.
Or if, as must frequently be the case,
a compromise take place, they and their god will
reserve the foremost rank, although the conquered
or otherwise subjected people may retain a share
in the state, and vindicate for their ancient deities
a portion of reverence and cult: the gods of nature,
of the earth and agriculture, thus yield for a while
to the supremacy of the gods of mental cultivation
and warlike prowess: Demeter gives way before
Apollo, afterwards however to recover a portion of
her splendour: Odinn obtains the soul of the warrior
and the freeman; Ðórr must content himself
with that of the thrall.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all the cases described,—to which we may add
violent conquest by a migratory body, leaving only
garrisons and governors behind it<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c008'><sup>[227]</sup></a>,—the family or
tribe which are the ruling tribe, are those in whom
the highest rank, dignity, nobility and power are
inherent: but unless some peculiar circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>arising within the ruling tribe itself, limit the succession
to the members of one household, as for
example among the Jews, the sanctity of the tribe
will be general and not individual. They will be
alone qualified to hold the high and sacred offices;
but the will of the whole state<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c008'><sup>[228]</sup></a>, <i>i. e.</i> popular election,
must determine which particular man shall be invested
with their functions. Out of the noble race
the election cannot indeed be made, but the choice
of the individual noble is, at first, free. This is the
simplest mode of stating the problem: history however
is filled with examples of compromise, where
two or more noble tribes divide the supreme authority
in even or uneven shares: two kings, for
instance, represent two tribes of Dorians in the
Spartan πολιτεια<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c008'><sup>[229]</sup></a>. The seven great and hereditary
ministerial houses in the German empire, the
five great Ooloos of the Dooraunee Afghans, with
their hereditary offices, represent similar facts.
Among the old Bavarians, the Agilolfings could
alone hold the ducal dignity, but three or four
other families possessed a peculiar nobility, raising
them nearly as much above the rest of the nobles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>as the nobles were raised above the rest of the
people. Under these circumstances the attributes
of sovereignty may be continually apportioned: to
one family it may belong to furnish kings or judges;
to another, generals; to a third, priests<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c008'><sup>[230]</sup></a>; or this
division may have arisen in course of time, within
a single family. Or again, the general may only
have been chosen, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro re nata</i></span>, when the necessity
of the case required it, from among the judges
or priests, or even from among those who were
not capable by birth of the judicial or sacerdotal
power. We are able to refer to an instance in
support of this assertion; Beda<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c008'><sup>[231]</sup></a> says of the Oldsaxons,
that is, the Saxons of the continent: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non
enim habent regem iidem antiqui Saxones, sed
satrapas plurimos, suae genti praepositos, qui, ingruente
belli articulo, mittunt aequaliter sortes, et
quemcumque sors ostenderit, hunc tempore belli
ducem omnes sequuntur, huic obtemperant; peracto
autem bello, rursum aequalis potentiae omnes
fiunt satrapae.</span>” And this throws light upon what
Tacitus asserts of the Germanic races generally<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c008'><sup>[232]</sup></a>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis et principes, qui iura
per pagos vicosque reddunt.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>The early separation of the judicial from the
strictly sacerdotal functions, to a certain degree at
least, is easily conceived. It would be mere matter
of convenience, as soon as a population became
numerous and widely dispersed. Yet to a very late
period among the Teutons we find traces of the
higher character. The ordeal or judgment of God,
the casting of lots and divination, are all derived
from and connected with priesthood. The heathen
place of judgment was sanctified to the gods by
priestly ceremonies; nor can it be supposed that
the popular councils were held without a due inauguration
by religious rites, or a marked exertion
of authority by the priests. Tacitus speaking of
these parliaments makes the intervention of the
priest the very first step to business: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut turbae
placuit, considunt armati. Silentium per sacerdotes,
quibus tum et coercendi ius est, imperatur</span><a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c008'><sup>[233]</sup></a>.”
The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena-gemót</span> of later times was opened by
the celebration of mass<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c008'><sup>[234]</sup></a>, and even yet Mr. Speaker
goes to prayers. During the flourishing period
of Christianity among the Anglosaxons, synods of
the bishops and their clergy were commanded to be
held twice a year, to act as supreme courts of justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>at least in civil causes<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c008'><sup>[235]</sup></a>. The law of the Visigoths,
while it recognizes a separation of the persons,
implies a confusion of the jurisdiction: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si
iudex vel sacerdos reperti fuerint nequiter iudicasse</span><a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c008'><sup>[236]</sup></a>.”
The people, it is true, found the judgment
or verdict, but the judge declared the law,
pronounced the sentence, and most probably superintended
the execution: in this he represented at
once the justice of the god, and the collective power
of the state. Thus then we may conclude that at
first in every Mark, and more especially in every
Gá or Scír, when various Marks had coalesced,
there was found at least one man of a privileged
family, who either permanently or for a time conducted
the public affairs during peace, and was,
from his functions, not less than his descent, nearly
connected with the religion of the people and the
worship of the gods: whether this man be called
ealdorman, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iudex</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>rex</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>satrapa</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>princeps</i></span>, seems
of little moment: he is the president of the freemen
in their solemn acts, as long as peace is maintained,
the original King of the shire or small nation.
If he be by birth a priest, and distinguished
by military talents, as well as elected to be a judge,
he unites all the conditions of kingship<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c008'><sup>[237]</sup></a>: and,
under such circumstances, he will probably not only
extend his power over neighbouring communities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>but even render it permanent, if not hereditary, in
his own: a similar process may take place, if the
priest or judge be one, the general another, of the
same household. We may conclude that the regal
power grows out of the judicial and sacerdotal, and
that, whether the military skill and authority be
superadded or not, <em>king</em> is only another name for
the judge of a small circuit<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c008'><sup>[238]</sup></a>. It is only when many
such districts have been combined, when many
such smaller kings have been subdued by one more
wise, more wealthy, powerful or fortunate than
themselves, that the complete idea of the German
kingdom developes itself: that the judicial, military,
and even, in part, the priestly powers sink into a
subordinate position, and the kingdom represents
the whole state, the freemen, the nobles, and the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>folcriht</i></span> or public law of both. It is thus that the
king gains the ultimate and appellate jurisdiction,
the right of punishment, and the general conservancy
of the peace, as well as the power of calling
the freemen to arms (cyninges ban, cyninges útware).
When this process has taken place the former kings
have become <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>subreguli</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>principes</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>duces</i></span>, ealdormen:
they retain their nobility, their original purity of
blood, their influence perhaps over their people;
but they have sunk into subordinate officers of a
state, of which a king at once hereditary and
elective is the head<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c008'><sup>[239]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>We are tolerably familiar with the fact that at
least eight kingdoms existed at once in Saxon England;
but many readers of English history have
yet to learn that royalty was much more widely
spread, even at the time when we hear but of
eight, seven or six predominant kings: as this is
a point of some interest, a few examples may not
be amiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that from the very earliest times
Kent had at least two kings, whose capitals were
respectively Canterbury and Rochester, the seat of
two bishoprics<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c008'><sup>[240]</sup></a>. The distinction of East and West
Kentings is preserved till the very downfall of the
Saxon monarchy: not only do we know that Eádríc
and Hlóðhere reigned together; but also that
Wihtred and his son Æðelberht the Second did
so<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c008'><sup>[241]</sup></a>. Óswine is mentioned as a king of Kent during
the period when our general authorities tell
us of Ecgberht alone<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c008'><sup>[242]</sup></a>; contemporary with him we
have Swæbheard, another king<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c008'><sup>[243]</sup></a>, and all these extend
into the period usually given to Eádríc and
Hlóðhere. The later years of Æðelberht the
Second must have seen his power shared with Eádberht<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c008'><sup>[244]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Eardwulf<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c008'><sup>[245]</sup></a>, Sigirǽd<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c008'><sup>[246]</sup></a> and Ecgberht<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c008'><sup>[247]</sup></a>, and Sigirǽd
deliberately calls himself king of half Kent.
A very remarkable document of Eádbehrt is preserved
in the Textus Roffensis<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c008'><sup>[248]</sup></a>; after the king’s own
signature, in which he calls himself Rex Cantuariorum,
his nobles place their names, thus, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego
Wilbaldus comites meos confirmare et subscribere
feci:</span>” and in the same words Dimheahac, Hósberht,
Nothbalth, Banta, Ruta and Tidbalth sign. Now
the fact of these persons having <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comites</i></span> at all is
only conceivable on the supposition that they were
all royal, kings or sub-kings. That they were subordinate
appears from the necessity of the grant
being confirmed by Æðelberht, which took place
in presence of the grantor and grantee, and the
Archbishop, at Canterbury. Among the kings of
this small province are also named Æðelríc, Heardberht,
Eádberht Pren<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c008'><sup>[249]</sup></a> and Ealhmund<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c008'><sup>[250]</sup></a>, the last
prince, father of the celebrated Ecgberht of Wessex.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the territories which at one time or other
were incorporated with the kingdom of Mercia, one
is celebrated under the name of Hwiccas: it comprised
the then diocese of Worcester. This small
province not only retained its king till a late period<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c008'><sup>[251]</sup></a>,
but had frequently several kings at once; thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Ósric<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c008'><sup>[252]</sup></a> and Óshere<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c008'><sup>[253]</sup></a>; Æðelweard<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c008'><sup>[254]</sup></a>, Æðelheard<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c008'><sup>[255]</sup></a>,
Æðelríc<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c008'><sup>[256]</sup></a> and in all probability Óswudu, between
an. 704-709. A few years later, viz. between an.
757 and 785, we find three brothers Eánberht<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c008'><sup>[257]</sup></a>,
Ealdred<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c008'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and Uhtred<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c008'><sup>[259]</sup></a> claiming the royal title in
the same district, while Offa their relative swayed
the paramount sceptre of Mercia. That other parts
of that great kingdom had always formed separate
states is certain: even in the time of Penda (who
reigned from 626 to 656) we know that the Middle
Angles were ruled by Peada, his son<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c008'><sup>[260]</sup></a>, while Merewald,
another son, was king of the West Hecan or
people of Herefordshire<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c008'><sup>[261]</sup></a>. In the important battle
of Winwidfeld, where the fall of Penda perhaps
secured the triumph of Christianity, we learn that
thirty royal commanders fell on the Mercian side<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c008'><sup>[262]</sup></a>.
Under Æðilræd, Penda’s son and successor, we
find Beorhtwald calling himself a king in Mercia<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c008'><sup>[263]</sup></a>.
During the reign of Centwine in Wessex, we hear
of a king, Baldred, whose kingdom probably comprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Sussex and part of Hampshire<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c008'><sup>[264]</sup></a>; at the same
period also we find Æðilheard calling himself king
of Wessex<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c008'><sup>[265]</sup></a>, and perhaps also a brother Æðilweard<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c008'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
unless this be an error of transcription. Friðuwald
in a charter to the Monastery of Chertsey, mentions
the following <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>subreguli</i></span> as concurring in the
grant: Ósríc, Wighard and Æðelwald<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c008'><sup>[267]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a kingdom of Elmet in Yorkshire,
and even till the tenth century one of Bamborough.
The same facts might easily be shown of Eastanglia<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c008'><sup>[268]</sup></a>,
Essex and Northumberland, were it necessary;
but enough seems to have been said to show how
numerously peopled with kings this island, always
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fertilis tyrannorum</i></span><a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c008'><sup>[269]</sup></a>, must have been in times whereof
history has no record. As a chronicler of the
twelfth century has very justly said, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ea tempestate
venerunt multi et saepe de Germania, et occupaverunt
Eástangle et Merce sed necdum sub
uno rege redacti erant. Plures autem proceres
certatim regiones occupabant, unde innumerabilia
bella fiebant: proceres vero, quia multi erant, nomine
carent</span><a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c008'><sup>[270]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From all that has preceded, it is clear that by
the term King we must understand something very
different among the Anglosaxons from the sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which we attach to the word: one principal difference
lies indeed in this, that the notion of territorial
influence is never for a single moment involved
in it. The kings are kings of tribes and peoples,
but never of the land they occupy,—kings of the
Westsaxons, the Mercians or the Kentings, but not
of Wessex, Mercia or Kent. So far indeed is this
from being the case, that there is not the slightest
difficulty in forming the conception of a king,
totally without a kingdom:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solo rex verbo, sociis tamen imperitabat</span>”<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c008'><sup>[271]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>is a much more general description than the writer
of the line imagined. The Norse traditions are full
of similar facts<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c008'><sup>[272]</sup></a>. The king is in truth essentially
one with the people; from among them he springs,
by them and their power he reigns; from them he
receives his name; but his land is like theirs, private
property; one estate does not owe allegiance
to another, as in the feudal system: and least of
all is the monstrous fiction admitted even for a
moment, that the king is owner of all the land in a
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Teutonic names for a king are numerous
and various, especially in the language of poetry;
many of them are immediately derived from the
words which denote the aggregations of the people
themselves: thus from þeód, we have the Anglosaxon
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeóden</span>; from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folc</span>, the Old Norse <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">Fylkr</span>;
but the term which, among all the Teutons, properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>denotes this dignity, is derived from the fact
which Tacitus notices, viz. the nobility of the king:
the Anglosaxon <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyning</span> is a direct derivative from
the adjective <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyne</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>generosus</i></span>, and this again from
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyn</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>genus</i></span><a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c008'><sup>[273]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The main distinction between the king and the
rest of the people lies in the higher value set upon
his life, as compared with theirs: as the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
or life-price of the noble exceeds that of the freeman
or the slave, so does the life-price of the king
exceed that of the noble. Like all the people he
has a money value, but it is a greater one than is
enjoyed by any other person in the state<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c008'><sup>[274]</sup></a>. So
again his protection (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mund</span>) is valued higher than
that of any other: and the breach of his peace
(<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cyninges handsealde frið</span>) is more costly to the
wrong-doer. He is naturally the president of the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena-gemót</span> and the ecclesiastical synod, and the
supreme conservator of the public peace.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the king belonged the right of calling out the
national levies, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>posse comitatus</i></span>, for purposes of
attack or defence; the privilege of recommending
grave causes at least to the consideration of the
tribunals; the reception of a certain share of the
fines legally inflicted on evil-doers, and of voluntary
gifts from the free men; and as a natural and rapid
consequence, the levy of taxes and the appointment
of fiscal officers. Consonant with his dignity were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the ceremonies of his recognition by the people, and
the outward marks of distinction which he bore:
immediately upon his election he was raised upon
a shield and exhibited to the multitude, who greeted
him with acclamations<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c008'><sup>[275]</sup></a>. Even in heathen times it
is probable that some religious ceremony accompanied
the solemn rite of election and installation:
the Christian priesthood soon caused the ceremony
of anointing the new king, perhaps as head of the
church, to be looked upon as a necessary part of
his inauguration. To him were appropriated the
waggon and oxen<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c008'><sup>[276]</sup></a>; in this he visited the several
portions of his kingdom, traversed the roads, and
proclaimed his peace upon them; and I am inclined
to think, solemnly ascertained and defined the national
boundaries<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c008'><sup>[277]</sup></a>,—a duty symbolical in some
degree, of his guardianship of the private boundaries.
Among all the tribes there appear to have
been some outward marks of royalty, occasionally
or constantly borne: the Merwingian kings were
distinguished by their long and flowing hair<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c008'><sup>[278]</sup></a>, the
Goths by a fillet or cap; among the Saxons the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>cynehelm, or cynebeáh, a circle of gold, was in use,
and worn round the head. In the Ðing or popular
council he bore a wand or staff: in wartime he was
preceded by a banner or flag. The most precious
however of all the royal rights, and a very jewel
in the crown, was the power to entertain a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comitatus</i></span>
or collection of household retainers, a subject
to be discussed in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The king, like all other freemen, was a landed
possessor, and depended for much of his subsistence
upon the cultivation of his estates<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c008'><sup>[279]</sup></a>. In various
parts of the country he held lands in absolute property,
furnished with dwellings and storehouses, in
which the produce of his farms might be laid up,
and from one to another of which he proceeded,
as political exigencies, caprice, or the consumption
of his hoarded stock rendered expedient. In each
villa or wíc was placed a bailiff, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>villicus</i></span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wícgeréfa</i></span>,
whose business it was to watch over the kings interests,
to superintend the processes of husbandry,
and govern the labourers employed in production;
above all to represent the king as regarded the
freemen and the officers of the county court.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The lot, share, or, as we may call it, τεμενος of
the king, though thus divided, was extensive, and
comprised many times the share of the freeman.
We may imagine that it originally, and under ordinary
circumstances would be calculated upon the
same footing as the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>; that if the life of the
king was seventy-two times as valuable as that of
the ceorl, his land would be seventy-two times as
large; if the one owned thirty, the other would
enjoy 2160 acres of arable land. But the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>comitatus</i></span>
offers a disturbing force, which, it will hereafter
be seen, renders this sort of calculation nugatory
in practice; and the experience of later periods
clearly proves the king to have been a landowner
in a very disproportionate degree. In addition to
the produce of his own lands, however, the king
was entitled to expect voluntary gifts in kind,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>naturalia</i></span>, from the people, which are not only distinctly
stated by Tacitus<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c008'><sup>[280]</sup></a> to have been so given,
but are frequently referred to by early continental
historians<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c008'><sup>[281]</sup></a>. In process of time, when these voluntary
gifts had been converted into settled payments
or taxes, further voluntary aids were demanded,
upon the visit of a king to a town or country, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>marriage of a princess, or of the king himself, and
other public and solemn occasions; from which in
feudal times arose the custom of demanding aids
from the tenants to knight the lord’s son or marry
his daughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another source of the royal revenue was a share
of the booty taken in war, where the king and the
freemen served together. The celebrated story of
Clovis and the Soissons vase<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c008'><sup>[282]</sup></a>, proves that the king
received his portion by lot, as did the rest of his
army; but there is no reason to doubt that his
share as much exceeded that of his comrades, as
his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> and landed possessions were greater
than theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>As conservator of the public peace, the king was
entitled to a portion of the fines inflicted on criminals,
and the words in which Tacitus mentions
this fact show that he was in this function the representative
of the whole state<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c008'><sup>[283]</sup></a>: it is a prerogative
derived from his executive power. And similar to
this is his right to the forfeited lands of felons,
which, if they were to be forfeited, could hardly be
placed in other hands than those of the king, as
representative of the whole state<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c008'><sup>[284]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>In proportion as this idea gains ground, the influence
of the king in every detail of public life
necessarily increases, and the regalia or royal rights
become more varied and numerous: he is looked
upon as the protector of the stranger, who has no
other natural guardian, inasmuch as no stranger
can be a member of any of those associations which
are the guarantee of the freeman. He has the sole
right of settling the value and form of the medium
of exchange: through his power of calling out the
armed force, he obtains rights which can only consist
with martial law,—even the right of life and
death<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c008'><sup>[285]</sup></a>: the justice of the whole country flows from
him: the establishment of fiscal officers dependent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>upon himself places the private possessions of the
freeman at his disposal. The peculiar conservancy
of the peace, and command over the means of internal
communication enable him to impose tolls
on land- and water-carriage: he is thus also empowered
to demand the services of the freemen to
receive and conduct travelling strangers, heralds or
ambassadors from one royal vill to another; to demand
the aid of their carts and horses to carry
forage, provisions or building-materials to his royal
residence. Treasure-trove is his, because where
there is no owner, the state claims the accidental
advantage, and the king is the representative of
the state. It is part of his dignity that he may
command the aid of the freemen in his hunting
and fishing; and hence that he may compel them
to keep his hawks and hounds, and harbour or
feed his huntsmen. As head of the church he has
an important influence in the election of bishops,
even in the establishment of new sees, or the abolition
of old established ones. His authority it is
that appoints the duke, the geréfa, perhaps even
the members of the Witena-gemót. Above all, he
has the right to divest himself of a portion of these
attributes, and confer them upon those whom he
pleases, in different districts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The complete description of the rights of Royalty,
in all their detail, will find a place in the Second
Book of this work; they can only be noticed cursorily
here, inasmuch as they appertain, in strictness,
to a period in which the monarchical spirit, and
the institutions proper thereto, had become firmly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>settled, and applied to every part of our social
scheme. But whatever extension they may have
attained in process of time, they have their origin
in the rights permitted to the king, even in the remotest
periods of which we read.</p>

<p class='c001'>There cannot be the least doubt that many of
them were usurpations, gradual developments of an
old and simple principle; and it is only in periods
of advanced civilization that we find them alluded
to. Nevertheless we must admit that even at the
earliest recorded time in our history, the kings
were not only wealthy but powerful far beyond any
of their fellow-countrymen. All intercourse with
foreign nations, whether warlike or peaceful, tends
to this result, because treaties and grave affairs of
state can best be negotiated and managed by single
persons: a popular council may be very properly
consulted as to the final acceptance or rejection of
terms; but the settlement of them can obviously
not be beneficially conducted by so unwieldy a
multitude. Moreover contracting parties on either
side will prefer having to do with as small a number
of negotiators as possible, if it be only for the
greater dispatch of business. Accordingly Tacitus
shows us, on more than one occasion, the Senate
in communication with the princes, not the populations
of Germany<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c008'><sup>[286]</sup></a>: and this must naturally be
the case where the aristocracy, to whose body the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>king belongs, have the right of taking the initiative
in public business<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c008'><sup>[287]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But although we find a great difference in the
social position, wealth and power of the king, and
those of the noble and freeman, we are not to imagine
that he could at any time exercise his royal
prerogatives entirely at his royal pleasure<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c008'><sup>[288]</sup></a>: held in
check by the universal love of liberty, by the rights
of his fellow nobles, and the defensive alliances of
the freemen<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c008'><sup>[289]</sup></a>, he enjoyed indeed a rank, a splendour
and an influence which placed him at the head of
his people,—a limited monarchy, but happier than
a capricious autocracy: and the historian who had
groaned over the vices and tyranny of Tiberius,
Nero and Domitian, could give the noble boon of
his testimony to the eternal memory of the <em>barbarous</em>
Arminius.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r220'>220</a>. There is a tradition among the Swedes that if the gods expressed

Essufzyes were hereditary viziers: the Barukzyes, the family of Dost
Mahomet Khan, hereditary commanders in chief: the union of the

the ultimate ruin of the Suddozye princes. In the Mogul empire, the
great offices of state became hereditary, and the historians of India

basis of the Comitatus is in the superior wealth and
large possessions of the prince.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all ages of the world, and under all conditions
of society, one profound problem has presented
itself for solution; viz. how to reconcile the
established divisions of property with the necessities
of increasing population. Experience teaches us
that under almost any circumstances of social being,
a body of men possessed of sufficient food and
clothing have been found to increase and multiply
with a rapidity far too great to be balanced by the
number of natural or violent deaths: and it follows
therefore that in every nation which has established
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>a settled number of households upon several estates,
each capable of supporting but one household in
comfort, the means of providing for a surplus population
must very soon become an object of general
difficulty. If the paternal estate be reserved for
the support of one son, if the paternal weapons
descend to him, to be used in the feuds of his house
or the service of the state, what is to become of the
other sons who are excluded from the benefits of
the succession? In a few instances we may imagine
natural affection to have induced a painful, and
ultimately unsuccessful, struggle to keep the family
together: here and there cases may have occurred
in which a community was fortunate enough from
its position, to possess the means of creating new
estates to suit the new demand: and conquest, or
the forcible partition of a neighbouring territory,
may have supplied a provision for the new generation.
Tacitus indeed tells us<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c008'><sup>[290]</sup></a> that “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">numerum
liberorum finire aut quemquam ex agnatis necare,
flagitium habetur:”</span> yet tradition contradicts this,
and speaks of the exposure of children immediately
after birth, leaving it to the will of the father to
save the life of the child or not<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c008'><sup>[291]</sup></a>. And similarly
the tales of the North record the solemn and voluntary
expatriation of a certain proportion of the
people, designated by lot, at certain intervals of
time<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c008'><sup>[292]</sup></a>. However, in the natural course of things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>he who cannot find subsistence at home must seek
it abroad; if the family estate will not supply him
with support, he must strive to obtain it from the
bounty or necessities of others: for emigration has
its own heavy charges, and for this he would require
assistance; and in a period such as we are describing,
trade and manufacture offer no resources
to the surplus population. But all the single hides
or estates are here considered as included in the
same category, and it is only on the large possessions
of the noble that the poor freeman can hope
to live, without utterly forfeiting everything that
makes life valuable. Some sort of service he must
yield, and among all that he can offer, military
service, the most honourable and attractive to
himself, is sure to be the most acceptable to the
lord whose protection he requires.</p>

<p class='c001'>The temptation to engage in distant or dangerous
warlike adventures may not appear very great to
the agricultural settler, whose continuous labour
will only wring a mere sufficiency from the soil he
owns. It is with regret and reluctance that such
a man will desert the land he has prepared or
the crops he has raised, even when the necessity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of self-defence calls the community to arms. <a id='corr165.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='far'>Far</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_165.1'><ins class='correction' title='far'>Far</ins></a></span>
otherwise however is it with him who has no means
of living by the land, or whom his means place
above the necessity of careful, unremitting toil. The
prince, enriched by the contributions of his fellow-countrymen,
and the presents of neighbouring
states or dynasts, as well as master of more land than
he requires for his own subsistence, has leisure for
ambition, and power to reward its instruments. On
the land which he does not require for his own
cultivation, he can permit the residence of freemen
or even serfs, on such conditions as may seem expedient
to himself or endurable to them. He may
surround himself with armed and noble retainers,
attracted by his liberality or his civil and military
reputation<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c008'><sup>[293]</sup></a>, whom he feeds at his own table and
houses under his own roof; who may perform even
servile duties in his household, and on whose aid
he may calculate for purposes of aggression or defence.
Nor does it seem probable that a community
would at once discover the infinite danger to themselves
that lurks in such an institution: far more
frequently must it have seemed matter of congratulation
to the cultivator, that its existence spared
him the necessity of leaving the plough and harrow
to resist sudden incursions, or enforce measures of
internal police; or that the strong castle with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>band of ever-watchful defenders, existed as a garrison
near the disputable boundary of the Mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Germania of Tacitus supplies us with a detailed
account of the institution of the Comitatus,
which receives strong confirmation on every point
from what we gather from other authentic sources.
In his own words:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Illustrious birth or the great services of their
fathers give the rank of princes even to young
men: they are associated with the rest who have
already made proof of their greater powers. Nor is
there any shame in appearing among the comites<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c008'><sup>[294]</sup></a>.
Moreover, the Comitatus itself has its grades, according
to the judgment of him they follow; and
great is the emulation among the comites, as to
who shall hold the highest place in the estimation
of the prince, and among the princes, as to who
shall have the most numerous and the bravest
comites. This is dignity, this is power, to be ever
surrounded with a troop of chosen youths, a glory
in time of peace, and a support in war. Nor is it
only in their own tribe, but in the neighbouring
states as well, a name and glory, to be distinguished
for the number and valour of the comitatus; for
they are courted with embassies, and adorned with
presents, and keep off wars by their very reputation.
When it comes to fighting, it is dishonourable
for the prince to be excelled in valour, for the
comitatus not to equal the valour of the prince;
but infamous, and a reproach throughout life, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>return from battle the survivor of the prince. To
defend and protect him, to reckon to his glory even
one’s own brave deeds, this is the first and holiest
duty. The princes fight for victory, the comites
for the prince. If the state in which they spring is
torpid with long peace and ease, the most of these
young nobles voluntarily seek such nations as may
be engaged in war, partly because inaction does
not please this race, partly because distinction is
more easy of attainment under difficulties. Nor
can you keep together a great comitatus, save by
violence and war: since it is from the liberality of
the prince that they exact that war-horse, that
bloody and victorious lance. For feasts and meals,
ample though rude, take the place of pay. Wars
and plunder supply the means of munificence; nor
will you so readily persuade them to plough the
land or wait with patience for the year, as to challenge
enemies and earn wounds; seeing that it
seems dull and lazy to acquire with sweat what
you may win with blood<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c008'><sup>[295]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be difficult in a few lines to give anything
like so clear and admirable an account of the
peculiarities of the Comitatus, as Tacitus has left
us in this vigorous sketch; and little remains but to
show how his view is confirmed by other sources
of information, and to draw the conclusions which
naturally result from these premises.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the influence and operation of these associations
are justly attributed not only the conquests of
the various tribes, but the most important modifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in the law of the people. As the proper
name for the freeman is <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ceorl</span>, and for the born-noble
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">eorl</span>, so is the true word for the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comes</span>, or comrade,
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíð</span>. This is in close etymological connection with
síð, a journey, and literally denotes one who accompanies
another. The functions and social position
of the gesíð led however to another appellation:
in this peculiar relation to the prince, he is
þegn, a thane, strictly and originally a servant or
minister, and only noble when the service of royalty
had shed a light upon dependence and imperfect
freedom. Beówulf describes himself as the relative
and thane of Hygelác: but his royal blood and tried
valour make him also the head of a comitatus, and
he visits Heort with a selected band of his own
comrades, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">swǽse gesíðas</span>: they, like himself, belong
however to his lord, and are described as Hygelác’s
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">beódgeneátas, heorðgeneátas (tischgenossen,
heerdgenossen</span>), sharers in the monarch’s table and
hearth. A portion of the booty taken in war naturally
became the property of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíðas</span>; this
almost follows from the words of Tacitus; and
Saxo Grammaticus, who in this undoubtedly expresses
a genuine fact, although after a peculiar
fashion of his own, says of one of his heroes<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c008'><sup>[296]</sup></a>,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proceres non solum domesticis stipendiis colebat,
sed etiam spoliis ex hoste quaesitis: affirmare
solitus, pecuniam ad milites, gloriam ad ducem redundare
debere.</span>” And again<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c008'><sup>[297]</sup></a>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Horum omnium
clientelam rex liberali familiaritate coluerat. Nam
primis apud eum honoribus, habitum, cultos auro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>gladios, opimaque bellorum praemia perceperunt.</span>”

<p class='c021'>The same amusing author tells us<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c008'><sup>[299]</sup></a> how on some
occasion, in consequence of there being no queen in
a court, the comites were ill supplied with clothes,
a difficulty which they could only provide against
by inducing their king to marry: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Igitur contubernales
Frothonis circa indumentorum usum feminea
admodum ope defecti, quum non haberent
unde nova assuere, aut lacera reficere possent,
regem celebrandi coniugii monitis adhortantur.</span>”
There seems no reason to doubt the fact thus recorded,
however we may judge respecting its occurrence
in the time of Frotho. Similarly when
Siegfried set out upon his fatal marriage expedition
into Burgundy, he and his twelve comrades were
clothed by the care of the royal Síglint<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c008'><sup>[300]</sup></a>. From this
relation between the prince and the comites, are
derived the names appropriated to the former in
the epopoea, of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hláford</span>, lord, literally <em>bread-giver</em>:
sinces <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">brytta, beága brytta</span>, <em>distributor of treasure,
rings</em>; <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sincgifa</span>, <em>treasure-giver</em>, and the like. It is
clear also that a right to any share in the booty
could not be claimed by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíð</span>, as it undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>could by the free soldier in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Hereban</i></span>, but
depended entirely upon the will of the chief, and
his notions of policy: a right could not have been
described as the result of his liberality. In the
historical time of Charlemagne we have evidence of
this<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c008'><sup>[301]</sup></a>: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo accepto ... idem vir prudentissimus
idque largissimus et Dei dispensator magnam inde
partem Romam ad limina Apostolorum misit per
Angilbertum dilectum abbatem suum; porro reliquam
partem obtimatibus, clericis sive laicis, caeterisque
fidelibus suis largitus est:</span>” or, as it is
still more clearly expressed in the annals of Eginhart<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c008'><sup>[302]</sup></a>,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reliquum vero inter optimates et aulicos,
caeterosque in palatio suo militantes, liberali manu
distribuit.</span>” And similarly we are told of Æðelstán:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeda quae in castro reperta fuerat, et ea
quidem amplissima, magnifice et viritim divisa.
Hoc enim vir ille animo imperaverat suo, ut nihil
opum ad crumenas corraderet; sed omnia conquisita,
vel monasteriis, vel fidelibus suis, munificus expenderet<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c008'><sup>[303]</sup></a>.</span>”
The share of the freeman who served
under his geréfa, and not under a lord, was his own
by lot, and neither by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>largitio</i></span> nor <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberalitas</i></span>,—a
most important distinction, seeing that where all
was left to the arbitrary disposition of the chief,
the subservience of the follower would very naturally
become the measure of his liberality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relation of the Comites was one of fealty:
it was undertaken in the most solemn manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and with appropriate, symbolic ceremonies, out of
which, in later times, sprung homage and the
other incidents of feudality. All history proves
that it was of the most intimate nature; that even
life itself was to be sacrificed without hesitation if
the safety of the prince demanded it: the gesíðas
of Beówulf expose themselves with him to the attack
of the fiendish Grendel<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c008'><sup>[304]</sup></a>; Wígláf risks his own
life to assist his lord and relative in his fatal contest
with the firedrake<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c008'><sup>[305]</sup></a>; and the solemn denunciation
which he pronounces against the remaining
comites who neglected this duty, recalls the words
of Tacitus, and the infamy that attached to the survivors
of their chief<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c008'><sup>[306]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c001'>But we are not compelled to draw upon the stores
of poetry and imaginative tradition alone: the sober
records of our earlier annalists supply ample evidence
in corroboration of the philosophical historian.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>When Cwichelm of Wessex sent an assassin to cut
off Eáduuini of Northumberland, that prince was
saved by the devotion of his thane Lilia, who threw
himself between, and received the blow that was
destined for his master; in the words of Beda<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c008'><sup>[307]</sup></a>:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod cum videret Lilla minister regis amicissimus,

ictum pungentis; sed tanta vi hostis ferrum infixit,
ut per corpus militis occisi etiam regem vulneraret.</span>”
Again we learn that in the year 786, Cyneheard,
an ætheling of Wessex, who had pretensions to the
crown, surprised the king Cynewulf at the house
of a paramour at Merton, and there slew him. He
proffered wealth and honours to the comites of the
king, which they refused, and with small numbers
manfully held out till every one had fallen. On the
following morning a superior force of the king’s
thanes came up: to them again the ætheling offered
land and gold, but in vain: he was slain on the
spot with all his own comites, who refused to desert
him in his extremity. This is the account given
of these facts in the words of the Saxon Chronicle

<p class='c001'>Æthelweard, Florence of Worcester, and Henry of
Huntingdon all follow the chronicle, which in some
details they apparently translate. William of
Malmesbury seems to adopt the same account, but
adds a few words which have especial reference
to this portion of the argument<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c008'><sup>[309]</sup></a>: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quorum (<i>i. e.</i>
comitum) qui maximus aevo et prudentia Osricus,
caeteros cohortatus ne necem domini sui in insignem
et perpetuam suam ignominiam inultam dimitterent,
districtis gladiis coniuratos irruit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is obvious that from this intimate relation between
the prince and the gesíð must arise certain
reciprocal rights and duties, sanctioned by custom,
which would gradually form themselves into a
code of positive law, and ultimately affect the state
and condition of the freemen. In the earliest development
of the Comitatus, it is clear that the
idea of freedom is entirely lost; it is replaced by
the much more questionable motive of <em>honour</em>, or
to speak more strictly, of rank and station. The
comes may indeed have become the possessor of
land, even of very large tracts<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c008'><sup>[310]</sup></a>, by gift from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>prince; but he could not be the possessor of a free
Hide, and consequently bound to service in the
general <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>fyrd</i></span>, or to suit in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span>: he might
have wealth, and rank and honour, be powerful
and splendid, dignified and influential, but he could
not be free: and if even the freeman so far forgot
the inherent dignity of his station as to carry himself
(for his éðel I think he could not carry) into the
service of the prince,—an individual man, although
a prince, and not as yet the state, or the representative
of the state,—can it be doubted that the remunerative
service of the chief would outweigh the
barren possession of the farmer, or that the festive
board and adventurous life of the castle would soon
supply excuses for neglecting the humbler duties
of the popular court and judicature? Even if the
markmen razed him from their roll, and committed
his éðel to a worthier holder, what should he care,
whom the liberality of his conquering leader could
endow with fifty times its worth; and whose total
divorce from the vulgar community would probably
be looked upon with no disfavour by him who had
already marked that community for his prey? Nor
could those whom the gesíð in turn settled upon
lands which were not within the general mark-jurisdiction,
be free markmen, but must have stood towards
him in somewhat the same relation as he
stood to his own chief. Upon the plan of the larger
household, the smaller would also be formed: the
same or similar conditions of tenure would prevail;
and the services of his dependants he was no doubt
bound to hold at the disposal of his own lord, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to maintain for his advantage. We have thus, even
in the earliest times, the nucleus of a standing
army, the means and instruments of aggrandizement
both for the King and the praetorian cohorts
themselves; practised and delighting in battle, ever
ready to join in expeditions which promised adventure,
honour or plunder, feasted in time of peace,
enriched in time of war; holding the bond that
united them to their chief as more sacred or stringent
than even that of blood<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c008'><sup>[311]</sup></a>, and consequently
ready for his sake to turn their arms against the
free settlers in the district, whenever his caprice, his
passion or his ambition called upon their services.
In proportion as his power and dignity increased
by their efforts and assistance, so their power and
dignity increased; his rank and splendour were reflected
upon all that surrounded him, till at length
it became not only more honourable to be the unfree
chattel of a prince, than the poor free cultivator
of the soil, but even security for possession
and property could only be attained within the
compass of their body. As early as the period
when the Frankish Law was compiled, we find the
great advantage enjoyed by the Comes over the
Free Salian or Ripuarian, in the large proportion
borne by his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, in comparison with that of
the latter<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c008'><sup>[312]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The advantage derived by the community from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the presence and protection of an armed force such
as the gesíðas constituted, must have gradually
produced a disposition to secure their favour even
at the expense of the free nobles and settlers: and
a Mark that wished to entrust its security and its
interests to a powerful soldier, would probably soon
acquiesce in his assuming a direction and leadership
in their affairs, hardly more consistent with
their original liberty, than the influence which a
modern nobleman may establish by watching, as
it is called, over the interests of the Registration.
Even the old nobles by blood, who gradually beheld
themselves forced down into a station of comparative
poverty and obscurity, must have early hastened
to give in their adhesion to a new order of things
which held out peculiar prospects of advantage to
themselves; and thus, the communities deserted by
their natural leaders, soon sunk into a very subordinate
situation, became portions of larger unities
under the protection, and ultimately the rule,
of successful adventurers, and consented without a
struggle to receive their comites into those offices
of power and distinction which were once conferred
by popular election.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíðas</span> were not free, and could not take
a part in the deliberations of the freemen at the
folcmót, or in the judicial proceedings, except in
as far as they were represented by their chief,
means for doing justice between themselves became
necessary: these were provided by the establishment
of a system of law, administered in the lord’s
court, by his officers, and to which all his dependants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>were required to do suit and service as amply
as they would, if free, have been bound to do in
the folcmót. But the law, administered in such a
court, and in those formed upon its model in the
lands of the comites themselves,—a privilege very
generally granted by the king, at least in later
periods<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c008'><sup>[313]</sup></a>,—was necessarily very different from that
which could prevail in the court of the freemen:
it is only in a lord’s court that we can conceive
punishments to have arisen which affected life and
honour, and fealty with all its consequences to have
attained a settled and stringent form, totally unknown
to the popular judicature. Forfeiture, or
rather excommunication, and pecuniary mulcts,
which partook more of the nature of damages than
of fine, were all that the freeman would subject
himself to under ordinary circumstances. Expulsion,
degradation, death itself might be the portion
of him whose whole life was the property of a lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to be by him disposed of at his pleasure. Hence
the forfeiture of lands for adultery and incontinence,
and hence even Ælfred affixes the penalty of death
to the crime of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hláfordsyrwe</span>, or conspiracy against
a lord<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c008'><sup>[314]</sup></a>, while manslaughter could still be compounded
for by customary payments. One or two
special cases may be quoted to show how the relation
of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíð</span> to his chief modified the general
law of the state.</p>

<p class='c001'>The horse and arms which, in the strict theory
of the comitatus, had been the gift, or rather the
loan of the chief, were to be returned at the death
of the vassal, in order, according to the same theory,
that they might furnish some other adventurer with
the instruments of service<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c008'><sup>[315]</sup></a>. These, technically
called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Heregeatwe</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>armatura bellica</i></span>, have continued
even to our own day under the name of
Heriot, and strictly speaking consist of horses and
weapons. In later imitation of this, the unfree settlers
on a lord’s land, who were not called upon
by their tenure to perform military service, were
bound on demise to pay the best chattel (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>melius
catallum</i></span>, <em>best head</em>, in German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">beste haupt</span>, heriot-custom,
as opposed to heriot-service) to the lord,
probably on the theoretical hypothesis that he, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the commencement of the tenancy, had supplied
the necessary implements of agriculture. And this
differs entirely from a Relief<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c008'><sup>[316]</sup></a>, because Heriot is the
act of the leaving, Relief the act of the incoming
tenant or heir<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c008'><sup>[317]</sup></a>; and because in its very nature
and amount Heriot is of a somewhat indefinite
character, but Relief is not.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the strict theory of the comitatus, the gesíð
could possess no property of his own; all that he
acquired was his lord’s, and even the liberalities
of the lord himself were only <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficia</i></span> or loans,
not absolute gifts<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c008'><sup>[318]</sup></a>: he had the usufruct only during
life, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium utile</i></span>: the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium directum</i></span>>
was in the lord, and at the death of the tenant it is
obvious that the estate vested in the lord alone:
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíð</span> could have no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius testamenti</i></span>, as indeed
he had no family: the lord stood to him in place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of father, brother and son. Hereditary succession,
which must at first have been a very rare exception,
could only have arisen at all either from the voluntary
or the compelled grant of the lord: it could
only become general when the old distinction between
the free markman and the gesíð had become
obliterated, and the system of the Comitatus had
practically and politically swallowed up every other.
Yet even under these circumstances it would appear
that a perfectly defined result was not attained;
and hence, although the document entituled “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rectitudines
singularum personarum</span>” numbers the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius testamenti</i></span> among the rights of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þegen</span><a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c008'><sup>[319]</sup></a>, yet
even to the close of the Anglosaxon monarchy, we
find dukes, præfects, kings’ thanes, and other great
nobles humbly demanding permission from the king
to make wills, entreating him not to disturb their
testamentary dispositions, and even bribing his
acquiescence by including him among the legatees.
In this as in all human affairs, a compromise
was gradually found necessary between opposing
powers, and the king as well as the comites, neither
of whom could dispense with the assistance of the
other, found it advisable to make mutual concessions.
I doubt whether at even an earlier period
than the eleventh century, the whole body of thanes
would have permitted the king to disregard the
testament of one of their body, unless upon definite
legal grounds, as for example grave suspicion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of treason: but still they might consent to the
nominal application and sanction of the ancient
principle, by allowing the insertion of a general
petition, that the will might stand, in the body of
the instrument<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c008'><sup>[320]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The circumstances thus brought under review
show clearly that the condition of the gesíð was
unfree in itself; that even the free by birth who
entered into it, relinquished that most sacred inheritance,
and reduced themselves to the rank of
thanes, ministers or servants. Certain rights and
privileges grew up, no doubt, by custom, and the
counts were probably not very long subject to the
mere arbitrary will of the chief: they had the protection
of others in a similar state of dependency
to their own, and chances, such as they were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of subservience to the king’s wishes: a bond of
affection and interdependence surpassing that of
blood, and replacing the mutual free guarantee of
life and security, was formed between them; and
they shared alike in the joys and sorrows, the
successes and reverses of peace and war: but with
it all, and whatever their rank; they were in fact
menials, housed within the walls, fed at the table,
clothed at the expense of their chief; dependent
upon his bounty, his gratitude or forbearance, for
their subsistence and position in life; bound to
sacrifice that life itself in his service, and, strictly
considered, incapable of contracting marriage or
sharing in the inestimable sanctities of a home.
They were his cupbearers, stewards, chamberlains
and grooms; even as kings and electors were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the emperor, whom they had raised out of their
own body. The real nature of their service appears
even through the haze of splendour and dignity
which gradually surround the intimate servants
of royalty; and as the chief might select his comites
and instruments from what class he chose,
it was the fate of these voluntary thanes, not unfrequently
to be numbered in the same category
with the unfree by birth, and thus, in their own
persons, to witness the destruction of that essential
principle of all Teutonic law, the distinction between
the freeman and the serf<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c008'><sup>[321]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Great indeed ought to be the advantages which
could compensate for sacrifices like these, and great
in their eyes, beyond a doubt, they were. In return
for freedom, the gesíð obtained a certain maintenance,
the chance of princely favour, a military
and active life of adventure, with all its advantages
of pillage, festivals and triumphs, poets and minstrels,
courtly halls and adventitious splendour;
the usufruct at least, and afterwards the possession,
of lands and horses, arms and jewels. As the royal
power steadily advanced by his assistance, and the
old, national nobility of birth, as well as the old,
landed freeman sunk into a lower rank, the gesíð
found himself rising in power and consideration proportioned
to that of his chief: the offices which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>passed from the election of the freemen to the gift
of the crown<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c008'><sup>[322]</sup></a>, were now conferred upon him, and
the ealdorman, duke, geréfa, judge, and even the
bishop, were at length selected from the ranks of
the comitatus. Finally, the nobles by birth themselves
became absorbed in the ever-widening whirlpool;
day by day the freemen, deprived of their old
national defences, wringing with difficulty a precarious
subsistence from incessant labour, sullenly
yielded to a yoke which they could not shake off,
and commended themselves (such was the phrase)
to the protection of a lord; till a complete change
having thus been operated in the opinions of men,
and consequently in every relation of society, a
new order of things was consummated, in which
the honours and security of service became more
anxiously desired than a needy and unsafe freedom;
and the alods being finally surrendered, to be taken
back as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>beneficia</i></span>, under mediate lords, the foundations
of the royal, feudal system were securely laid
on every side.</p>

I thank my father, with all humility, in the name of Almighty God,
for the answer which he sent me on the Friday after Midsummer day,
by Ælfgár Æffa’s son; that was, that he told me, upon my father’s
word, that I might, by God’s leave and his, grant my realty and chattels,
as I thought best, whether for spiritual or temporal ends. And the witnesses
to this answer are Eádmund,” etc. Cod. Dipl. No. 722. Lastly,
Ælfhelm concludes his will with these words: “Now I entreat thee,
my dear lord, that my will may stand, and that thou permit not that
any man should set it aside. God is my witness that I was ever obedient
to thy father, to the utmost of my power, and full faithful to

the mund of another, and represented by him in
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">folcmót</span>) are various; one, viz. poverty arising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>from over-population, has been noticed in the last
chapter; but I agree with Eichhorn<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c008'><sup>[324]</sup></a> and Grimm<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c008'><sup>[325]</sup></a>,
in attributing the principal and original cause of
slavery in all its branches to war and subsequent
conquest. Another and important cause is forfeiture
of liberty for crime; and the amount of
dependence, the gentler or harsher condition of the
serf, depends to a great extent upon the original
ground of servitude. If the victor has a right to
the life of the vanquished, which by the law of
nature is unquestionably the case, he possesses <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>à
fortiori</i></span> a perfect claim to the person, the property
and the services of his prisoner, if his self-interest
or the dictates of humanity induce him to waive
that right<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c008'><sup>[326]</sup></a>. These remarks apply no doubt, in
their full force, only to our pagan forefathers; but
even Christianity itself did not at once succeed in
rooting out habits which its divine precepts of justice
and mercy emphatically condemn. Beda, in
his desire to prove the efficacy of the mass for the
dead<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c008'><sup>[327]</sup></a>, tells an interesting story of a young noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>who was left severely wounded on the field, after a
battle between Ecgfrið of Northumberland and
Æðelred of Mercia, in the year 679. Fearful of
the consequences should his rank be discovered, he
disguised himself in the habit of a peasant, and assumed
that character, at the castle of the earl into
whose hands he fell; declaring that he was a poor,
and married man<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c008'><sup>[328]</sup></a>, who had been compelled to attend
the army with supplies of provisions. But his
language and manners betrayed him, and at length,
under a solemn promise of immunity, he revealed
his name and station. The reply of the earl is characteristic;
he said: “I knew well enough from
thy answers that thou wert no rustic; and now indeed
thou art worthy of death, seeing that all my
brothers and relations were slain in that battle:
yet I will not kill thee, lest I should break the
faith that I have pledged.” Accordingly when his
wounds were healed, his captor sold him to a Frisian
in London, who, finding that he could not be bound,
finally released him on his parole and permitted
him to ransom himself. Whatever the motive, it
is thus clear that the victor possessed the right of
life and death over his captive, even when taken in
cold blood; and the traditions, as well as the historical
records of the northern nations are filled with
instances of its exercise.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>It does not however by any means follow that
the total defeat of a hostile tribe resulted in the immediate
and direct enslaving of all the survivors:
as in the example just cited, the blood-feud no
doubt frequently led to the murder of the captive
chiefs and nobles, even if less justifiable motives
did not counsel the same miserable means of removing
dangerous competitors<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c008'><sup>[329]</sup></a>; but the heavy
doom of death must have been one of the melancholy
privileges of the noble class: and even though
many of the common freemen may have been sold
or retained as slaves at the caprice of the captors,
still we cannot suppose this to have been the lot of
any but those who had actually taken part in combat;
no natural or national law could extend these
harsh provisions to the freemen who remained quiet
at home. Nevertheless even these were liable to
be indirectly affected by the hostile triumph, inasmuch
as the conquerors appear invariably to have
taken a portion, more or less great, of the territory
occupied by the conquered<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c008'><sup>[330]</sup></a>: and wherever this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the case to the extent of depriving the cultivator of
means sufficient for his support, he has no resource
but to place himself in dependence upon some
wealthier man, and lose, together with his lot or
κληρος, the right to form an integral part of the
state: the degree of his dependence, and the consequent
comparative suffering to himself, may vary
with a multitude of circumstances; but the one fact
still remains, viz. that he is in the mund or hand
of another, represented in the state by that other,
and consequently, in the most emphatic sense of
the word, <em>unfree</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is now generally admitted that this must have
been the case with the whole population in some
districts, who thus became dependent upon a few
intrusive lords: but still these populations cannot
be said to have stood in that peculiar relation to
the conquerors, which the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servus</i></span> strictly implies
towards an owner. The utmost extent of their
subjection probably reached no further than the
payment of tribute, the exclusion from military
duty and the standing under a protectorate<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c008'><sup>[331]</sup></a>. Inglorious
and easy, when once the dues of the lord
were paid, they may even have rejoiced at being
spared the danger of warfare and the laborious suit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of the folcmót, and forgotten that self-government
is the inherent right and dignity of man, in the
convenience of having others to defend and rule
them. Moreover the territorial subjection was not
necessarily a juridical one: indeed some of the Teutonic
conquerors recognized as positive law, the
right of even the dependent Romans and Provincials
to be judged and taxed according to the rules
and maxims of Roman, not Salic or Langobardic,
jurisprudence: and this, when carried out in the
fullest detail with respect to the various tribes at
any time united under one supreme head, constitutes
what is now called the system of <em>Personal
Right</em>, whereby each man enjoyed the law and forms
of law to which he was born, without the least
reference to the peculiar district in which he might
happen to live; in other words, that he carried his
own law about, whithersoever he went, as a quality
attached to his own person, and not in the slightest
degree connected with or dependent upon any particular
locality. In this way Alamanni, Baiowari,
Saxons, Frisians, Langobards, Romans, Gallic provincials
and Slavonic populations, were all united
under the empire of the Salic and Ripuarian Franks<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c008'><sup>[332]</sup></a>.
The peculiar circumstances under which the conquest
took place must, of course, have defined the
relations under which the subject stood to the ruling
state. It is conceivable that the conquerors might
not want land, but be contented with glory and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>pillage; or they might not be able to seize and
retain the conquered territory: or again they may
have required new settlements for themselves and
their allies, to obtain which they waged a war of
extermination. Thus the Suevi, although unable
to expel the Ubii altogether from their territory,
yet succeeded in rendering them tributary<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c008'><sup>[333]</sup></a>; while
in Thuringia, the Franks and their Saxon allies
seized all the land, slaying, expelling or completely
reducing the indigenous inhabitants to slavery.
Another and curious instance may be cited from a
comparatively late period, when the little island of
Man was invaded, conquered and colonized by the
Norwegian Godred. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Godredus sequenti die optionem
exercitui suo dedit, ut si mallent Manniam
inter se dividere et in ea habitare, vel cunctam
substantiam terrae accipere et ad propria remeare.
Hiis autem magis placuit totam insulam vastare,
et de bonis illius ditari, et sic ad propria reverti.
Godredus autem paucis qui secum remanserunt
de insulanis australem partem insulae, et reliquiis
Mannensium aquilonarem tali pacto concessit, ut
nemo eorum aliquando auderet iure haereditario
sibi aliquam partem terrae usurpare. Unde accidit
ut usque in hodiernum diem tota insula solius regis
sit, et omnes redditus eius ad ipsum pertineant<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c008'><sup>[334]</sup></a>.</span>”
The not being able to dispose of property hereditarily
is the true badge and proof of slavery.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Tacitus draws a great distinction between the
different degrees of servitude among the Germans.
He tells us that the unsuccessful gambler who had
staked and lost his liberty and the free disposal of
his own body upon one fatal cast of the dice, would
voluntarily submit to be bound and sold<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c008'><sup>[335]</sup></a>, but that
it was not usual for them to reduce their other serfs
to the condition of menials; they only demanded
from them a certain amount of produce (or, unquestionably,
of labour in the field or pasture), and
then left them the enjoyment of their own dwellings
and property<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c008'><sup>[336]</sup></a>. The general duties of the
house, beyond such supplies, which were provided
for among the Romans by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ministeria per familiam
descripta</i></span>, were left among the Germans to the wife
and children of the householder<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c008'><sup>[337]</sup></a>. It will be desirable
to follow a somewhat similar distinction in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>treating of the different kinds of slaves; and having
shown that one class of the unfree are those who
have been partially dispossessed by conquest, but
retain their personal freedom in some degree, to
proceed to those who are personally unfree, the
mere chattels of a lord who can dispose of them at
his pleasure, even to the extent of sale, mutilation
and death. The class we have hitherto been observing
is that intended by the term Læt in Anglosaxon,
Litus, Lito, Lazzo, etc. in German monuments<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c008'><sup>[338]</sup></a>,
and the Laeti of the Romans, applied by
them to the auxiliary Germans settled on imperial
land, and bound to pay tribute and perform military
service. They formed, as Grimm has well observed,
a sort of middle class among the unfree; comprising
the great majority of those who, without being
absolutely their own masters, were yet placed somewhat
above the lowest and most abject condition
of man, which we call slavery. This condition
among our forefathers was termed <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeówet</span>; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servus</i></span>
was <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeów</span>, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ancilla</i></span> <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeówen</span>; or, as the original
serfs of the English were the vanquished Britons,
Wealh and Wyln.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without confining ourselves to the definition in
the law of Henry the First, we may distribute the
different kinds of slaves into classes, according to
the different grounds of slavery<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c008'><sup>[339]</sup></a>. Thus they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>serfs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>casu</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>natura</i></span>, and the serfs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>casu</i></span> comprise
serfs by the fortune of war, by marriage, by settlement,
by voluntary surrender, by crime, by superior
legal power, and by illegal power or injustice. The
remaining class are serfs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>natura</i></span>, or by birth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The serfs by fortune of war were those who were
not left under the public law to enjoy a portion of
their ancient freedom and possessions, but were
actually reduced to a state of prædial or menial
servitude by their captors, and either reserved for
household drudgery or sold, at their arbitrary will.
The Cassandra and Andromache of Grecian story
stand here side by side with our own German
Gudrún. This part of the subject has received sufficient
illustration from the tale of the thane Imma,
already quoted from Beda.</p>

<p class='c001'>The serf by marriage was the free man or free
woman who contracted that bond with a slave: in
this case the free party sank to the condition of the
unfree, among some at least of the German races.
The Salic law is explicit upon this point both with
respect to man and woman<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c008'><sup>[340]</sup></a>: among the Ripuarian
Franks it was enacted thus<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c008'><sup>[341]</sup></a>: “If a free Ripuarian
woman hath followed a Ripuarian serf, let the king
or the count offer unto her a sword and a spindle:
if she accept the sword, let her therewith slay the
serf; if the spindle, let her abide with him in servitude.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>In this case the Burgundian law<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c008'><sup>[342]</sup></a> commanded
both parties to be slain; but if the relatives
of the woman would not put her to death, she
became a serf of the king. Saxo Grammaticus cites
a similar law for Denmark<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c008'><sup>[343]</sup></a>. There is no evidence
of the Anglosaxon practice in this respect, but it
appears unlikely that the case should be of common
occurrence. Probably purchase and emancipation
always preceded such marriages, and the
law of Henry the First makes no mention of this
among the grounds of slavery<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c008'><sup>[344]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The serf by settlement is he who has taken up
his abode in a district exclusively inhabited by the
unfree; and to this refers the German expression
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die luft macht eigen,</span>” i. e. the air makes the serf.
There is no distinct Anglosaxon provision on the
subject, but perhaps we may include in this class
some at least of those who taking refuge on a lord’s
land, and among his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sócmen</span>, without any absolute
and formal surrender of their freedom, did actually
become his serfs and liable to the services due
to him from all their neighbours<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c008'><sup>[345]</sup></a>. The generality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>however of such cases fall under the next following
head, viz.—</p>

<p class='c001'>The serfs by surrender, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sua datione servus</i></span> of
Henry’s law, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servus dedititius</i></span>, and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">giafþræl</span> of
the Norse law. Among these Grimm numbers the
serfs whose voluntary submission so much surprised
the Roman philosopher. Even the law of the Germans,
so generally favourable to liberty, contemplates
and provides for the case of such a voluntary
servitude<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c008'><sup>[346]</sup></a>. This might arise in various ways. For
example, a time of severe scarcity, such as are only
too often recorded in our ancient annals, unquestionably
drove even the free to the cruel alternative
of either starvation or servitude: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Subdebant se
pauperes servitio, ut quantulumcunque de alimento
porrigerent,</span>” says Gregory of Tours<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c008'><sup>[347]</sup></a>; Gildas tells
us a similar tale of the Britons<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c008'><sup>[348]</sup></a>; and even as late
as the Norman conquest we find Geatflǽd, a lady,
directing by her will the manumission of all those
who had bent their heads in the evil days for food<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c008'><sup>[349]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Another was, no doubt, debt, incurred either through
poverty or crime; and when the days of fierce and
cruel warfare had passed away, this must have been
the most fertile source of servitude. I have not
found among the Anglosaxon remains any example
of slavery voluntarily incurred by the insolvent
debtor, but the whole course of analogy is in favour
of its existence, and Marculf supplies us with the
formulary by which, among the Franks, the debtor
surrendered his freedom to the creditor. It may be
presumed that this servitude had a term, and that
a certain period of servile labour was considered
equivalent to the debt. The case of crime was undoubtedly
a very common one, especially as those
whose necessities were the most likely to bring
them in collision with the law were those also who
were least able to fulfil its requirements, by payment
of the fines attached to their offences. The
criminal whose own means were insufficient, and
whose relatives or lord would not assist him to make
up the legal fine he had incurred, was either compelled
to surrender himself to the plaintiff, or to
some third party who paid the sum for him, by
agreement with the aggrieved party. This was
technically called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þingian</span><a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c008'><sup>[350]</sup></a>, and such a serf was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>called a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witeþeów</span>, convict, or criminal slave. These
are the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servi redemptione</i></span> of Henry the First.</p>

<p class='c001'>Serfs by force or power are not those comprised
in the first class of these divisions, or serfs by the
fortune of war: these of course have lost their freedom
through superior force. But the class under
consideration are such as have been reduced to servitude
by the legal act of those who had a right to
dispose of them; as, for instance, a son or daughter
by the act of the father<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c008'><sup>[351]</sup></a>. It is painful to record
a fact so abhorrent to our Christian feelings, but
there cannot be the least doubt that this right was
both admitted and acted upon. The father, upon
whose will it literally depended whether his child
should live or not, had a right at a subsequent period
to decide whether the lot of that child should
be freedom or bondage<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c008'><sup>[352]</sup></a>. Illegitimate children, the
offspring of illicit intercourse with his wyln or
þeówen, may have formed the majority of those thus
disposed of by a father: but in times of scarcity,
it is to be feared that even the issue of legitimate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>marriage was not always spared<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c008'><sup>[353]</sup></a>. The Frisians,
when oppressed by the amount of Roman tribute,
sold their wives and children: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ac primo boves
ipsos, mox agros, postremo corpora coniugum aut
liberorum servitio tradebant<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c008'><sup>[354]</sup></a>:</span>” this is however an
exceptional case, and the sale of wives and children
appears only to have been resorted to as a last resource.
But the very restriction to the exercise of
this right, within particular limits of time—which we
may believe the merciful intervention of the church
to have brought about—speaks only too plainly for
its existence in England. Even as late as the end
of the seventh century, and after Christianity had
been established for nearly one hundred years in
this country, we find the following very distinct
and clear recognitions of the right, in books of
discipline compiled by two several archbishops for
the guidance of their respective clergy. In the
Poenitential of Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury,
occurs this passage: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater filium suum septem
annorum, necessitate compulsus, potestatem habet
tradere in servitium; deinde, sine voluntate filii,
licentiam tradendi non habet<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c008'><sup>[355]</sup></a>.</span>” In the somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>later Confessionale of Ecgberht, archbishop of York,
we find: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater potest filium suum, magna necessitate
compulsus, in servitutem tradere, usque ad
septimum annum; deinde, sine voluntate filii, eum
tradere non potest<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c008'><sup>[356]</sup></a>.</span>” It is however very remarkable
that in the Poenitential of the same Ecgberht
the sale of a child or near relative is put down as
an offence punishable by excommunication<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c008'><sup>[357]</sup></a>. These
are the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servi alterius datione</i></span> of Henry the First.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next head includes the serfs by reason of
crime. The distinction between these and the class
of criminals who became slaves through compact
or redemption, is that in their case servitude was
the direct punishment of their offence, and not
merely an indirect and mediate consequence. It
seems to me at least that this sense strictly lies at
the foundation of two laws of Eádweard, Ælfred’s
son; of these the former says<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c008'><sup>[358]</sup></a>, “If any one through
conviction of theft forfeit his freedom, and deliver
himself up, and his kindred forsake him, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>know not who shall make bót for him; let him then
be worthy of the þeówwork which thereunto appertained;
and let the wer abate from the kindred.”
Again, “If a freeman work upon a festival
day, let him lose his freedom, or pay the wíte or
lahslite<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c008'><sup>[359]</sup></a>.” This alternative is an alleviation of the
strict law: but as forfeiture undoubtedly followed
upon theft and other offences, the thief could not
expect to make bót for himself, and was always
exposed to the danger of incurring slavery, should
another make it for him. It is however possible
that his relations may have interfered to save him,
without the reducing him to a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servus dedititius</i></span>; or
even if he were so reduced, he became the serf of
him that engaged (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þingode</span>) for him; whereas, if
not rescued at all, he must have been a fiscal serf,
in the hands of the crown or the geréfa, its officer.
There exists therefore a perceptible difference between
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíteþeów</span> whom the law made so, (even
though it permitted a merciful alternative,) and
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíteþeów</span> whose punishment would have been a
mulct which exceeded his means. The law of other
German tribes numbers slavery among its punishments
without any reservation at all: thus among
the Visigoths, he that assisted in the escape of a
serf, and neither restored him nor his worth to the
owner, was to become a slave in his place<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c008'><sup>[360]</sup></a>. By
the Bavarian law, he that could not pay a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
due from him, was to be enslaved together with his
wife and children<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c008'><sup>[361]</sup></a>. Grimm<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c008'><sup>[362]</sup></a> cites the following case:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Richilda, quae libertatem suam fornicando polluit,
amisit ... filiae illorum liberae permaneant,
... nisi forte adulterio vel fornicatione polluantur.</span>”
It is true that the Anglosaxon laws do not
give us any enactment of a corresponding nature:
nevertheless I entertain no doubt that incontinence
was a ground of slavery in the case both of man
and woman. Toward the end of the ninth century,
Denewulf, bishop of Winchester, leased the lands
of Alresford to a relative of his own, on condition
of a yearly rent: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Is equidem insipiens, adulterans,
stuprum, propriam religiose pactatam abominans,
scortum diligens, libidinose commisit. Quo reatu,
omni substantia peculiali recte privatus est, et praefatum
rus ab eo abstractum rex huius patriae suae
ditioni avidus devenire iniuste optavit<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c008'><sup>[363]</sup></a>.</span>” However
unjust the canons of Winchester might think it, it
is clear that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena-gemót</span> did not; for the
bishop was obliged to pay 120 mancusses in gold to
the king, to have back his own land. Again in the
year 1002, we hear of a lady forfeiting her lands to
the king, by reason of incontinence<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c008'><sup>[364]</sup></a>. The consequences
of this destitution can hardly have been
other than servitude; and it may be at once admitted
that where there were no lands to forfeit, servitude
was the recognized punishment of the offence.
Theodore<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c008'><sup>[365]</sup></a> when apportioning the penance due to it,
says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si intra viginti annos puella et adolescens
peccaverint, i annum, et in secundo iii quadragesimas
ac legitimas ferias. Si propter hoc peccatum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>servitio humano addicti sunt, iii quadragesimas.</span>”
Again, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maritus si ipse seipsum in furto aut fornicatione
servum facit, vel quocunque peccato<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c008'><sup>[366]</sup></a>,</span>” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last division of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servi casu</i></span> comprises
those who have been reduced to slavery by violence
or fraud, in short illegally. Illegitimate children,
poor relations, unfriended strangers, young persons
without power of self-defence, may thus have been
seduced or forced into a servile condition of life,
escape from which was always difficult, inasmuch
as there is necessarily a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span> case against
the serf, and he can have no standing in the court
composed only of the free. To this head seem referable
the passages I have already alluded to in
Theodore’s Poenitential<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c008'><sup>[367]</sup></a>, and which I will now cite
at length: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis Christianus alterum Christianum
suaserit, ac in alteram regionem seduxerit,
ibique eum vendiderit pro proprio servo, ille non
est dignus inter Christianos requiem habere, donec
redimat eum et reducat ad proprium locum.</span>” And
again: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis Christianus alterum Christianum
vagantem reppererit, eumque furatus fuerit ac vendiderit,
non debet habere inter Christianos requiem,
donec redimat eum, et pro illo furto septem annos
poeniteat<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c008'><sup>[368]</sup></a>.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>The other great division includes all the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>servi
natura</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nativi</i></span>, or serfs by reason of unfree birth;
and as these are necessarily the children either of
parents who are both unfree, or (under particular
circumstances) of one unfree parent, it follows that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>their hereditary condition may arise from any one
of the conditions heretofore under examination.
All the legitimate children of two serfs are themselves
irrevocably serfs<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c008'><sup>[369]</sup></a>: but some distinctions
arise where the parents are of unequal condition,
as where the mother is free, the father unfree, and
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>. In this respect the law was very different
among the different tribes: the Swedish law
declared in favour of liberty<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c008'><sup>[370]</sup></a>, the German generally
the other way<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c008'><sup>[371]</sup></a>. The Sachsenspiegel decides that
the children follow the father’s right<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c008'><sup>[372]</sup></a>, and similarly
the law of Henry the First<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c008'><sup>[373]</sup></a> has, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis de servo
patre natus sit et matre libera, pro servo reddatur
occisus;</span>” and again, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si pater sit liber et mater
ancilla, pro libero reddatur occisus;</span>” on the general
principle that “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper a patre non a matre generacionis
ordo texitur,</span>” which Fortescue confirms,
saying<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c008'><sup>[374]</sup></a>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Angliae nunquam matris, sed semper
patris conditionem imitari partum iudicat, ut ex
libera etiam ex nativa non nisi liberum liber generet,
et non nisi servum in matrimonio procreare
potest servus.</span>” Fleta’s argument rests upon the
same doctrine<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c008'><sup>[375]</sup></a>. Glanville however appears to adopt
the contrary view<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c008'><sup>[376]</sup></a>, which agrees with the maxim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>of the civil law, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Partus sequitur ventrem.</span>” To
the English principle I am bound to give my adhesion,
inasmuch as the natural and the original
social law can recognize none but the father, either
in the generation, or in the subsequent rule, of the
family: whatever alleviation the practices of chivalry,
the worship of the Virgin mother, and the
Christian doctrine of the equality of man and woman
before God, may have introduced, the original
feeling is on the father’s side, and the foundations
of our law are based upon the all-sufficiency of
his right. A woman is in the mund or keeping of
a man; society exists for men only, that is, for
women merely as far as they are represented by a
man.</p>

<p class='c001'>That this original right was interfered with by
the law of property is not denied. But here different
cases are to be considered. First, whether
the serf or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nativa</i></span> is the property of the party who
unites with him or her. Secondly whether the free
party unite with some other owner’s serf or neif;
next, whether the issue are born in wedlock or not;
and lastly how far the public law and right is involved
in the question of freedom and servitude.
The last consideration in fact involves the first,
because, under the first, except in the case of hardly
intelligible neglect, marriage could never take place
between two unequal parties at all: emancipation
must have preceded the ceremony; while the civil
law would of course rule that the ceremony itself,
taking place by consent, was an act of emancipation
not to be gainsaid. It is therefore with regard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>to third parties only that a question can arise<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c008'><sup>[377]</sup></a>.
There is no proof that such a question ever did arise
among the Anglosaxons, or that it was thought
needful to provide for it by law: and the earlier
evidences with which this book has especially to do
are either entirely silent, or so general in their expressions
that we cannot decide from them upon a
particular case. In fact the whole argument is reduced
to the second head, viz. where one parent is
the property of a third party, and where the child
is born in lawful wedlock; for a child not so born
is not subject to any law which binds the parents, is
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nullius filius</i></span>, and can as little be injured as advantaged
by the law.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the strict Anglosaxon law there is no definite
decision on these points: the codes of other German
races, at the oldest period, are equally silent.
In later times indeed we have determinations; but
these, as we have observed, are contradictory.
Perhaps we may take the doctrine of the Sachsenspiegel,
coinciding as it does with the opinion of
many, probably a majority, of our own law-sages,
as the original one, especially as it is the only one
in accordance with other details of family life, and
with the supreme law of nature itself which leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>to the father the decision as to the life or death of
the child, as to its liberty or slavery. In this sense
then I agree with Sir John Fortescue and Sir Edward
Coke<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c008'><sup>[378]</sup></a>. It is to be remembered that we are
dealing now with the condition of the offspring,
not of the parent: the uncertainty that prevails
with respect to the latter, in the Anglosaxon law,
and the contradictory enactments of other German
codes have been already noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'>But all that has been said applies solely to the
case of children born in lawful wedlock; and
almost all the apparent contradictions which have
been noticed in our own law, arise from a want
of clear distinction on this point. The child of a
free father and unfree mother, if the parents were
not married, remained to the lord of the neif, according
to our expressive proverb, “Mine is the
calf that is born of my cow<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c008'><sup>[379]</sup></a>.” In Fleta’s words<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c008'><sup>[380]</sup></a>
the distinction is drawn most clearly, and they may
therefore stand here in place of my own: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Servi
autem aut nascuntur aut fiunt; nascuntur quidem
ex nativo et nativa solutis vel copulatis, et eius erit
servus in cuius potestate nasci contigerit<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c008'><sup>[381]</sup></a>; dum
tamen de soluta nativa, domini loci, quia sequitur
conditionem matris, a quocunque fuerit genitus,
libero vel nativo<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c008'><sup>[382]</sup></a>. Si autem copulati fuerint et
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>genitus fuerit partus a libero, licet a nativa, partus
erit liber; et si de servo et libera in matrimonio,
servus erit.</span>” Thus, here again the offspring follows
the father, as soon as there is a marriage to
determine that there is an offspring at all, in law;
but if there be no marriage, the chattel thrown into
the world, like any other waif or stray belongs
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>domino loci</i></span>; it has a value, can be worked or sold;
it is treasure-trove of a sort, and as it belongs to
nobody else, falls to the lord, as a compensation
probably for the loss of his neif’s services during
pregnancy and the nonage of the child<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c008'><sup>[383]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whatever the origin of serfage may have been,
it can hardly be questioned that the lot of the serf
was a hard one; and this perhaps not so much
from the amount of labour required of him, as
from the total irresponsibility of the master, in the
eye of the law, as to all dealings between himself
and his þeów. The Christian clergy indeed did all
they could to mitigate its hardships, but when has
even Christianity itself been triumphant over the
selfishness and the passions of the mass of men!
The early pagan Germans, though in general they
treated their serfs well, yet sometimes slew them,
under the influence of unbridled passion: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verberare
servum ac vinculis et opere coercere rarum.
Occidere solent, non disciplina et severitate, sed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>impetu et ira, ut inimicum, nisi quod impune est<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c008'><sup>[384]</sup></a>.</span>”
The church affixed a special penance to the manslaughter
of a woman by her mistress, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>impetu et
ira</i></span>,—an event which probably was not unusual,
considering the power of a lord over his þeówen
or female slave,—and generally, a penance for the
slaughter of a serf by his lord without judicial authority<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c008'><sup>[385]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In contemplation of law, in fact, the slave is the
absolute property of his lord, a chattel to be disposed
of at the lord’s pleasure, and having a value
only for the benefit of the lord, or of some public
authority in his place. The serf cannot represent
himself or others: his interests must be guarded by
others, for he himself has no standing in any public
court. He is not in any friðborh, or association
for mutual guarantee, for he has nothing of his
own to defend, and no power to defend what another
has. If he be slain by a stranger, his lord claims
the damages, and not his children: if the lord himself
slay him, it is but the loss of so much value,—a
horse, an ox, gone—more or less. Out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>death no feud can arise, for the relatives who allowed
him to fall into, or remain in slavery, have
renounced the family bond, and forfeited both the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> and the mund. If he be guilty of wrong,
he cannot make compensation in money or in chattels;
for he can have no property of his own save
his skin: thus his skin must pay for him<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c008'><sup>[386]</sup></a>, and the
lash be his bitter portion. He cannot defend himself
by his own oath or the oaths of friends and
compurgators, but, if accused, must submit to the
severe, uncertain and perilous test of the ordeal.
And if, when thus hunted down, he be found guilty,
severe and ignominious punishment,—amounting,
in a case of theft, to death by flogging for men, by
burning for women,—is reserved for him<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c008'><sup>[387]</sup></a>. Naturally
and originally there can be no limitation in
the amount or the character of labour imposed upon
him, and no stipulation for reciprocal advantage
in the form of protection, food or shelter. Among
the Saxons the wíteþeów at least appears to have
been bound to the soil, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>adscriptus glebae</i></span><a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c008'><sup>[388]</sup></a>, conveyed
with it under the comprehensive phrase “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mid mete
and mid mannum:</span>” though in some few cases we
can trace a power, vested perhaps only in certain
public authorities, of transferring the slave from
one estate to another<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c008'><sup>[389]</sup></a>. Last, but most fearful of all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the taint of blood descended to his offspring, and
the innocent progeny, to the remotest generations,
were born to the same miserable fate as bowed down
the guilty or unfortunate parent.</p>

<p class='c001'>But yet there was a gleam of hope: one solitary
ray that made even the surrounding darkness tolerable,
and may have cheered the broken-hearted
serf through years of unrequited toil and suffering.
The law that reduced him to slavery made it also
possible that he should be restored to freedom. It
did not shut from him this blessing, however distant
it might seem. Tacitus knew of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>liberti</i></span> among
the Germans, men who had been slaves, had been
manumitted, and were free<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c008'><sup>[390]</sup></a>. Thus in yet pagan
times, general kindliness of disposition, habits of domestic
intercourse, perhaps the suggestions of self-interest,
may have tended to raise the condition of
the serf even to the restoration of freedom: but it
was the especial honour and glory of Christianity,
that while it broke the spiritual bonds of sin, it ever
actively laboured to relieve the heavy burthen of
social servitude. We are distinctly told that Bishop
Wilfrið, on receiving the grant of Selsey from
Caedwealha of Wessex, immediately manumitted
two hundred and fifty unfortunates, whom he found
there attached to the soil,—that those, whom by
baptism he had rescued from servitude to devils,
might by the grant of liberty be rescued from servitude
to man<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c008'><sup>[391]</sup></a>. In this spirit of charity, the clergy
obtained respite from labour for the þeów on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Sabbath, on certain high festivals and on the days
which preceded or followed them<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c008'><sup>[392]</sup></a>; the lord who
compelled his þeów to labour between the sunset
on Saturday and the sunset on Sunday, forfeited
him altogether<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c008'><sup>[393]</sup></a>; probably at first to the king or
the geréfa; but in the time of Cnut the serf thus
forfeited was to become <em>folkfree</em><a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c008'><sup>[394]</sup></a>. To their merciful
intervention it must also be ascribed that the
will of a Saxon proprietor, laic as well as clerical,
so constantly directs the manumission of a number
of serfs, for the soul’s health of the testator<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c008'><sup>[395]</sup></a>;
Ælfred even goes so far as to give free power to
the serf of bequeathing to whomsoever he pleases,
whatever may have been given him for God’s sake,
or he may have earned in his own moments of leisure<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c008'><sup>[396]</sup></a>;
and this provision, which probably implies a
prohibition to the lord of removing his labourer
arbitrarily from a plot of ground well cultivated by
his own efforts, tends to secure to the unfortunate
serf some interest in the produce of his industry:
the Hungarian will recognize in it the spirit of
Maria Theresia’s <cite>Urbarium</cite>. It is moreover obvious
from many surviving documents, that, in the later
periods, the serf could purchase his own release<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c008'><sup>[397]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>at least with the lord’s consent<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c008'><sup>[398]</sup></a>, or be bought by
another for the purpose of manumission<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c008'><sup>[399]</sup></a>, or even
be borrowed on pledge for a term of years<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c008'><sup>[400]</sup></a>, during
which his labour might be actively employed in
laying up the means of future freedom. It cannot
indeed be denied that the slave might be sold like
any other chattel, and that even as late as Æðelred
and Cnut, the law ventured to prohibit no more
than the selling him into heathendom, or without
some fault on his part<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c008'><sup>[401]</sup></a>: nor can we believe that
acts of the grossest oppression and tyranny were
unfrequent. But from what has been already cited,
it must be evident that there was a constantly
growing tendency in favour of freedom, that the
clergy suggested every motive, and the law made
every possible effort, at least to diminish the more
grievous circumstances of servitude. It is moreover
to be borne in mind that a very large proportion
of the þeówas at any given time, were in reality
criminal serfs, convicts expiating their offences by
their sufferings. Taking all the circumstances into
consideration, I am disposed to think that the mere
material condition of the unfree population was not
necessarily or generally one of great hardship. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>seems doubtful whether the labour of the serf was
practically more severe, or the remuneration much
less than that of an agricultural labourer in this
country at this day: his lord was bound to feed him
for his own sake, and if, when old and worn out, he
wished to rid himself of a useless burthen, he could
by an act of emancipation hand over his broken-down
labourer to the care of a Church which, with
all its faults, never totally lost sight of the divine
precepts of charity<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c008'><sup>[402]</sup></a>. We are not altogether without
the means of judging as to the condition of the
serf, and the provision made for him; although the
instances which we may cite are not all either of one
period, or one country, or indeed derived from
compilations having the authority of law, they show
sufficiently what opinion was entertained on this
subject by some among the ruling class. In the
prose version of Salomon and Saturn<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c008'><sup>[403]</sup></a>, it is said
that every serf ought to receive yearly seven hundred
and thirty loaves, that is, two loaves a day,
beside morning meals and noon meals; this cannot
be said to be a very niggardly portion. Again,
the valuable document entituled, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rectitudines
singularum personarum</span><a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c008'><sup>[404]</sup></a>,” gives details respecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the allowances made to the serfs in various prædial
or domestic capacities, which would induce a belief
not only that they were tolerably provided for, but
even enabled by the exertion of skill and industry
to lay up funds of their own towards the purchase
of their freedom, the redemption of their children,
or the alleviation of their own poverty. From the
same authority and others, we may conclude that
on an estate in general, serfs discharged the functions
of ploughman, shepherd, goatherd, swineherd,
oxherd and cowherd, barn-man, sower, hayward,
woodward, dairymaid, and beadle or messenger;
while the geneát, cotsetla, gebúr, beócere and gafolswán
were probably poor freemen from whom a
certain portion of labour could be demanded in
consideration of their holdings<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c008'><sup>[405]</sup></a>, or a certain rent
(gafol) reserved out of the produce of the hives,
flocks or herds committed to their care: and these
formed the class of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Læt</i></span> and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Esne</i></span>, poor mercenaries,
serving for hire or for their land, but not
yet reduced so low in the scale as the þeów or
wealh. It is not only probable that there would be
distinctions in the condition of various serfs upon
the same estate, but even demonstrable: it can
hardly be doubted that men placed in situations
of some trust, as the ploughman, oxherd or beadle,
were in a somewhat higher class, and of better condition,
than the mere hewers of wood and drawers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of water. Now in a charter of the year 902, we
find an interesting statement, which I must take
leave to cite<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c008'><sup>[406]</sup></a>: Denewulf bishop of Winchester
and his Chapter had leased land at Eblesburne to
Beornwulf, a relative of the bishop: the Chapter
sent word to Beornwulf that the men, that is the
serfs, were to remain attached to the land—“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæt
ða men móston on ðam lande wunian</span>”—whether
he, or any other, held it: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðonne wǽron ðǽr þreo
wíteþeówe men búrbǽrde, ⁊ þreo þeówbǽrde, ða
me salde bisceop ⁊ ða hiwan tó rihtre ǽhte ⁊ hira
teám:</span>” “Now there were three convicts <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">búrbǽrde</span>
and three <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þeówbǽrde</span>, whom the bishop and the
brethren gave me, together with their offspring.”
The expressions used in this passage seem to show
that some of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wíteþeówe</span> men upon this estate
enjoyed a higher condition than others<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c008'><sup>[407]</sup></a>, being <em>cultivators</em>
or <em>boors</em>, while the others were more strictly
slaves. The very curious and instructive dialogue
of Ælfríc numbers among the serfs the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">yrðling</span> or
ploughman, whose occupation the author nevertheless
places at the head of all the crafts, with perhaps
a partial exception in favour of the smith’s<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c008'><sup>[408]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Servitude ceased by voluntary or compulsory
manumission on the part of the lord; the latter
case being that where the services of the slave were
forfeited through the misconduct of the master.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>And as loss of liberty must be considered in the
main as a consequence of the public law, understood
in the general, and expressed in the particular
case, so must it I think be asserted, that <em>at
first</em> emancipation depended in some degree upon
the popular will as well as the mercy or caprice of
private individuals. It is no doubt true, that at
a period when what we now call crimes were rather
considered in the light of civil injuries, for
which satisfaction was due to the parties injured, it
might seem reasonable to leave the latter in possession
of the power to assess the minimum, at
least, of his own satisfaction: to allow him to decide
how long a period of servitude he would content
himself with, if he chose to renounce the right
he possessed of claiming an endless one; or lastly,
to reward good and faithful service by cancelling
the consequences of an earlier wrong. But emancipation
has two very different effects: it not only
relieves the serf from personal burthens and disabilities,
but it restores or introduces a citizen to
political and public rights. In a state of society
where landed possession and the exercise of such
rights are inseparable, a grave difficulty arises, viz.
how can provision be made for the newly emancipated,
and now free man? If the community will
consent, and possess the means, to create a new free
Hide for his occupation, of course the matter can
be managed; but this consent renders the emancipation
in reality the act of the state, not of the
manumittor. Or the lord on restoring freedom to
his serf may endow him with a portion of his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>land, sufficient for easy or even wealthy subsistence;
but this will not make him fully a free man, give
him his full position in the πολιτευμα or polity, and
place him on a level with the free inhabitants of
the Mark.</p>

<p class='c001'>Till periods very late in comparison with that
which is assumed in the course of this argument, a
similar principle prevails in our legislation upon this
subject. Glanville says, “It is also to be observed
that a man may enfranchise his serf in respect of
the persons of himself or his heirs, but not in respect
of others. For if any one, having once been
a serf, and afterwards having attained to freedom in
this manner, should be produced in court against a
third party to support a cause, or for the purpose
of making any law of the land, he may justly
be removed therefrom, if his birth in villenage
should be objected to and proved against him in
the court, even though the serf so enfranchised
should have come to be promoted unto a knight’s
degree<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c008'><sup>[409]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Later still, liberty seems considered as a privilege
the value of which might be diminished by its extension;
and Fleta gives as a reason why the lord
is bound to pursue his fugitive serf, “lest by <em>negligence</em>
of the lords, serfs should prevail to assert
their own freedom<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c008'><sup>[410]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On consideration therefore of all the facts, we
must conclude that where full and complete manumission
was intended, the transaction could only be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>completed in the presence and with the co-operation
of the community, whereby all claims besides
those of the manumitting lord would be formally
estopped for the future. And this would be nearly
equivalent to the admission (rare indeed) of a metic
or other stranger to the full rights of citizenship at
Athens, which could hardly have effect without a
ψήφισμα or deliberate vote of the whole people<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c008'><sup>[411]</sup></a>.
Accordingly even in the laws of William the Conqueror
and Henry the First we find evidence that
the completest publicity was given to formal manumissions<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c008'><sup>[412]</sup></a>;
and it is not unreasonable to believe
that this refers back to a time when such publicity
may have consisted in the presentation of the serf
before the assembled folcmót, and their expressed
or implied assent to the solemn act.</p>

<p class='c001'>Practically however, it is probable that the dissolution
of servitude did not absolutely confer all
the privileges of freedom. The numerous acts of
manumission directed by the wills of great landowners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>are totally inconsistent with the notion of
any interference on the part of the assembled people,
as necessary to their validity: the instances, it
is true, are mostly of modern date, but still we
hear of manumissions by wholesale at very early
periods, where nothing but the lord’s own will can
possibly be thought of<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c008'><sup>[413]</sup></a>. It seems therefore probable
that a certain amount of dependence was reserved;
that the freedman became relieved from
the harsher provisions of his former condition, but
remained in general under the protection and on
the land of his former lord, perhaps receiving wages
for services still rendered. In the eighth century
Wihtraed of Kent enacted that even in the case of
solemn manumission at the altar, the inheritance,
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> and the mund of the family should remain
to the lord, whether the new freedman continued
to reside within the Mark or not<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c008'><sup>[414]</sup></a>. The mode
of provision for the emancipated serf must, in a
majority of cases, have led to this result. The lord
endowed him out of his own land, either with a
full possession, secured by charter, or a mere temporary,
conditional loan, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>lǽn</i></span>: the man therefore
remained upon the lord’s estate, and in his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>borh</i></span>
or surety, though no longer liable to servile disabilities<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c008'><sup>[415]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The full ceremonies used in the solemn act of
emancipation by the Anglosaxons are not known to
us; but there is reason to suppose that they resembled
those of other Teutonic nations. Generally
these may be divided into civil and ecclesiastical;
the former receiving their sanction from the authority
of the people or the prince, the latter from
the church and its peculiar influences. “He who
would emancipate his serf shall deliver him to the
sheriff, by the right hand, in full county, shall proclaim
him free from all yoke of servitude by manumission,
shall show him open roads and doors,
and shall deliver unto him the arms of a free man,
namely the lance and sword: thenceforth the man
is free<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c008'><sup>[416]</sup></a>.” Such is the law of William the Conqueror,
and it is repeated with little variation by
Henry the First<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c008'><sup>[417]</sup></a>, except that there is no limitation
to the sheriff and the county. But this was also
one form of manumission among the Langobards.
The person who was to be made <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Fulfreal</i></span> was delivered
over successively into the hands of four
different persons: the last of these brought him
before witnesses to a spot where four roads met,
and his choice was given him of these roads. He
was then free, and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ámund</i></span>, that is removed from
under the protection of his former master<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c008'><sup>[418]</sup></a>. But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>appears that the master, even though he gave the
free roads, might reserve the mund of his freedman,
by which he retained the right of inheriting from
him, if he died childless<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c008'><sup>[419]</sup></a>; and this recalls to us
the provision already cited from the Kentish law<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c008'><sup>[420]</sup></a>.
The history of Ramsey informs us that Æðelstán,
the son of Manni, adopted this form in a very extensive
emancipation of his serfs<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c008'><sup>[421]</sup></a>, and we may
therefore suppose it to have been a mode usual
among the Saxons. Among the Franks, the fullest
and completest act of emancipation was that which
took place before the king, or in a popular court;
the freedman, from the ceremonies adopted on the
occasion, was called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Denarialis</i></span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Denariatus</i></span>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui
denarium ante regem iactavit.</span>” He became capable
of a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, of contracting marriage with a
free woman, and in general obtained all the rights
of a free citizen. But he still remained in some
degree under the mund of the king, who received
his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, and had certain rights over his inheritance<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c008'><sup>[422]</sup></a>.
I do not know whether this has any connexion
with a law of Henry the First, which provides
that in <em>any case</em> of manumission, the serf
shall give thirty pence to the lord, as a witness,
namely the price of his skin, for a testimony that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>he is thenceforth himself its master<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c008'><sup>[423]</sup></a>. There was a
form of manumission among the Franks by charter<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c008'><sup>[424]</sup></a>,
which however did not confer all the privileges of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>denarialis</i></span>. The holder of such a charter was
thence called Chartularius: I will not assert that
such a system prevailed here, although it is possible
that some of the many charters of emancipation,
printed in the Codex Diplomaticus, may be of this
nature. Their general character however is that of
a record of bargain and sale between different parties:
it may be indeed presumed that emancipation
would follow, but there is no positive statement
that it did. The following class of cases perhaps
approaches nearest to such a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>charta ingenuitatis</i></span>:
“By this book of the Gospels it appeareth that
Ælfwig the Red hath bought himself out, from Abbat
Ælfsige and all the convent, with one pound.
Whereof is witness all the brotherhood at Bath.
Christ blind him who turneth away this record<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c008'><sup>[425]</sup></a>!”
But this is only a memorandum in a copy of the
Gospels, no charter of manumission; and I presume
that the sheriff would have required some much
more definite and legal act, before he looked upon
Ælfwig the Red as a freeman. Probably he was
duly made free at the altar of the abbey church or
at the door<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c008'><sup>[426]</sup></a>. Of this subsequent process we have
a good example in the book of St. Petroc.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“This book beareth witness that Ælfsige bought
a woman called Ongyneðel, and her son Gyðiccæl,
of Ðurcil for half a pound, at the church-door in
Bodmin: and he gave to Ælfsige the portreeve and
Maccos the hundred-man, fourpence as toll. Then
came Ælfsige who bought these persons, and took
them, and freed them, ever sacless, on Petroc’s altar,
in the witness of these <em>good men</em>; that is, Isaac the
priest<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c008'><sup>[427]</sup></a>,” etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all forms of emancipation I imagine this to
have been the most frequent, partly because of its
convenience, partly because the motives for emancipation
were generally of a religious cast, and the
sanctions of religion were solemn and awful. Almost
all the records which we possess on this subject
are taken from the margins of Gospels or other
books belonging to religious houses, and the few
references in the laws imply emancipation at the
altar. Among the Franks this form, in which the
freedman was called Tabularius, conveyed only
imperfect freedom: the utmost it could do was to
confer the privileges of a Roman provincial, to
which class the clergy were reckoned: but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tabularius</i></span>
even so was not fully free; he still remained
in the mund of the church. Wihtræd’s law, so often
cited, shows clearly that this was not the case in
England; nor could it be, seeing that the clergy
among us were national, and the Frankish system
of <em>personal</em> rights did not prevail. I am therefore
disposed to think that gradually emancipation at
the altar was taken to convey all the privileges of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>manumission, and that it was the mode generally,
though not exclusively, in use. On this point, the
want of documents prevents our attaining certainty.
The method was probably this: the man was formally
offered up before the high altar, and there declared
free in the presence of the officiating clergy
and the congregation. A memorandum was then
made in some religious book belonging to the
church, and the names of the witnesses were recorded.
Whether a separate certificate was prepared
does not appear.</p>

<p class='c001'>The full extent of the rights obtained by the
freedman, especially in respect of inheritance, is
not to be gathered from any existing Anglosaxon
document. It is probable that these were limited,
as among the Langobards and Franks: his offspring
however were free, and his marriage with a free
woman, equal: his other rights, duties and privileges,
in short his general condition, were in all
probability determined by certain arrangements
between himself and his lord previous to the act of
manumission. In such a case neither party would
find much difficulty in settling the terms of a bargain.</p>

It is probable, nay even certain, that such records were preserved in all

tenants, perhaps also the poor freemen, held, who were thus the
ancient copyholders. The amount of the holdings was undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>settled by the custom of the county or the manor; and it is probable
that one measure prevailed for all tenants of similar grades. A record
of descents was necessary to regulate the claims of a lord to the families

depreciate the Saxons, in order to enhance the merit of their convertors.
I admit the probability of the fact, only because the right is
a direct corollary from the paternal power, and because Archbishops
Theodore and Ecgberht (the first a Roman missionary) recognize it;

with Theodor. Poen. xlii. § 3, 4, 5, which refer to sale of a

by Ecgberht, though omitted by Theodore. Perhaps we may
reconcile the passages, by assuming Ecgberht to refer to an illegal sale,
viz. when the child was above seven years old, but still in the same
category as those for whose safety Theodore provides by the same ecclesiastical

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> THE MUTUAL GUARANTEE. MÆGBURH. TITHING. <br /> HUNDRED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The organization in Marks and in the Gá or Scír
was a territorial one, based upon the natural conformation
of the country, common possession of the
soil and usufruct of its produce. It has been already
said that both of these divisions had their separate
courts of justice or parliaments, their judges and
executive officers. But some further machinery
was required to secure the public peace, to provide
for the exercise of what, in modern society, we call
the police, and to ensure the rights of the individual
markman, in respect to other markmen, as well
as his conformity to the general law. A corporate
existence was necessary, which should embrace a
more detailed system of relations than was to be
found either in the Mark or in the Shiremoot.
Strictly speaking, the former of these was principally
busied with the questions which arose out
of its own peculiar nature, that is, with offences
against the integrity of the frontier, the forest, the
rights of common in the pastures and meadows,
and other delinquencies of a public character. On
the other hand, the Shiremoot, though it must have
taken cognizance of disputed questions between
several Marks, and may, even from the first, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>exercised some description of appellate jurisdiction,
must naturally have considered the higher and more
general attributes of legislation and foreign policy,
the national rather than municipal administration,
as belonging to its peculiar and appropriate province.
Perhaps also the exigencies of military discipline
may gradually have rendered a more complicated
method of enrolment necessary, by means
of which companies and regiments might be kept
upon a permanent footing, and called into immediate
action when occasion demanded their services;
while, at the same time, due provision was
made for the tilling the lands of those whose personal
exertions were required in defence of the
public weal<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c008'><sup>[433]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were two forms in which these various
objects might be attained; these were, subordinate
organizations of men, not excessive in number, or
too widely dispersed, and founded either upon the
bond of blood or the ties of family, including that
of adoption, or merely upon an arbitrary numerical
definition. Each of these plans had advantages as
well as defects: the family bond alone did not secure
a sufficient territorial unity, although in practice
it had at first considerable influence upon the
location of individual households; moreover it gave
rise to an inequality continually on the increase,
and necessarily threatening to the independence of
the free men. On the other hand, any merely arbitrary,
numerical classification would have excluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>a most important social element, the responsibility
of man to man in the bond of kindred, the feelings
and engagements of family affection, family honour
and family ambition. The problem was finally
solved by a partial union of the two methods: in
all probability, the law of compromise which reigns
throughout all history, gradually brought about a
fusion of two separate principles, widely differing
in point of antiquity, and thus superinduced the
artificial upon the natural bond, without entirely
destroying the influence of the latter.</p>

<p class='c001'>For I think it unquestionable that the artificial
bond was really later in point of time: since, in
the first place, indefinite and vague arrangements
usually precede the definite and settled; and next,
because Tacitus takes no notice whatever of any
but the family bond, which he represents as stringent
in the highest degree. We have already seen
that Caesar declares the divisions of the land to
have taken place according to families or relationships,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cognationes</i></span><a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c008'><sup>[434]</sup></a>, from which we may infer
at first a considerable amount of territorial unity.
From his far more observant successor we learn
that the military organization was based upon the
same principle; that the composition of the troop
or regiment depended upon no accidental arrangement,
but was founded upon families or relationships<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c008'><sup>[435]</sup></a>;
and that every man was bound to take up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>the enmities as well as the friendships of his father
or kinsman<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c008'><sup>[436]</sup></a>. But leaving these earlier evidences,
it still seems that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Mǽgburh</span> or <em>Family-bond</em> is
an institution whose full comprehension is necessary
to a clear conception of the Anglosaxon public
and private life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea of the family is at once the earliest and
strongest of human ties; in its development it is
also the most ennobling to the individual and salutary
to the state; on it depend the honour and
dignity of woman, the unselfish education of man,
the training of children to obedience and love, of
parents to protection and justice, of all to love of
country and enlightened subordination to the state.
Where it does not exist, man becomes an instrument
in the hands of others, or the blind tool of
systems. In its highest form it is the representative
of that great mystery by which all Christians
are one brotherhood, united under one Father and
King. Throughout the latter day of ethnic civilization,
when the idea of <em>state</em> had almost ceased
to have power, and the idea of <em>family</em> did not exist,
there was a complete destruction both of public
and private morality; and the world, grown to be
a sink of filth and vice, was tottering to the fall
which Providence in mercy had decreed for its
purification. The irruption of the German tribes
breathed into the dead bones of heathen cultivation
the breath of a new life; and the individual dignity
of man as a member of a family,—the deep-seated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>feeling of all those nations,—while it prepared
them to become the founders of Christian states
which should endure, made them the wonder of
the philosophers and theologians of Rome, Greece
and Africa, and an example to be held up to the
degenerate races whom they had subdued<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c008'><sup>[437]</sup></a>. The
German house was a holy thing; the bond of marriage
a sacred and symbolic engagement<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c008'><sup>[438]</sup></a>; holy
above man was woman herself. Even in the depths
of their forests the stern warriors had assigned to
her a station which nothing but that deep feeling
could have rendered possible: this was the sacred
sex, believed to be in nearer communion with divinity
than men<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c008'><sup>[439]</sup></a>. In the superstitious tradition of
their mythology, it was the young and beautiful
Shieldmays, the maiden Wælcyrian, who selected
the champions that had deserved to become the
guests of Wóden. The matrons presided over the
rites of religion, conducted divinations<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c008'><sup>[440]</sup></a>, and encouraged
the warriors on the field of battle<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c008'><sup>[441]</sup></a>; Veledas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>and Aurinias, prophetesses in the bloom of
youth and beauty, led the raw levies of the North
to triumph over the veteran legions of Rome.
Neither rank nor wealth could atone for violated
chastity<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c008'><sup>[442]</sup></a>; nor were in general any injuries more
severely punished than those which the main
strength of man enabled him to inflict on woman<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c008'><sup>[443]</sup></a>.
That woman, nevertheless, <em>in the family</em>, held a
subordinate situation to men, lies in the nature of
the family itself, and in the disposition and qualities
which have been implanted in woman, to enable
her to fulfil her appointed duties in the scheme
of Providence; qualities not different in <em>degree</em>, but
<em>kind</em>, from those of her helpmate, that they may be
the complement of his, and, united with his, make
up the full and perfect circle of humanity. As
an individual, woman was considered a being of a
higher nature; as a member of the state, she was
necessarily represented by him upon whom nature
had imposed the joyful burthen of her support, and
the happy duty of her protection,—a principle too
little considered by those who, with a scarcely pardonable
sciolism, have clamoured for what they call
the rights of woman. Woman among the Teutons
was near akin to divinity, but not one among them
ever raved that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>femme libre</i></span> could be <em>woman</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence the profound importance attached to chastity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and the undoubted influence of alliances by
marriage<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c008'><sup>[444]</sup></a>, through which separate kindreds are
fused into one body, adopting common interests,
pursuing common objects, and recognizing in the
bond which unites its members, obligations which
are still exhibited in oriental countries, which we
trace throughout the middle ages of Europe, but
which are gradually vanishing under the conditions
of our modern mercantile society.</p>

<p class='c001'>It lies in the very nature of things that among a
people animated with such principles as have now
been described, and so placed by circumstances on
tracts of land far more than sufficient for their support,
the very earliest organization should be based
upon the family relations. Dwelling near to one another,
united by a community of interests and the
endearing ties of mutual relationship, or the scarcely
weaker bond of adoption,—strong as regards other
families in direct proportion to their union among
themselves,—the mǽgð or family offer all the guarantees
in their own natural position which the primitive
state can require. In the popular councils
the largest and most distinguished family has necessarily
the greatest weight; but association of
others, severally less powerful, is always capable of
counteracting danger which might arise in a free
state from the ambition of any of its portions. In
the absence of a central power,—or rather its dispersion
through all the several members of the community,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the collection of revenue and the maintenance
of the peace must be left to the heads of
the several fractions, whether villages (as in the
East), or families, which at one time are identical
with villages. The police therefore especially belongs
to the family, and is by it exercised over all
the individuals that compose it; hence also the
grave misconduct of the individual may justly have
the effect of destroying the social position of the
whole mǽgð. In Beówulf, the warriors who deserted
their prince in his utmost need, are sternly
told by his successor, that not only they, but their
whole mǽgburh will thenceforth have forfeited the
rights of citizenship,</p>

<p class='c022'>not, <em>each of you individually</em>, but <em>each and every man</em>
of your kin, cognation or mǽgsceaft, shall be deprived
of his rights of citizenship: from which we
must infer that the misconduct of one person might
compromise his relatives, who are held responsible
for his actions<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c008'><sup>[445]</sup></a>. And this rule, coupled with the
fact of all serving together, under one selected from
among themselves, and each under the eye of his
nearest and dearest friends, supplied a military organization
capable of enabling the <em>barbarians</em> to
cope with far more disciplined and scientific military
systems than their own; serving to explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>the almost irresistible power with which, like the
Turks of more recent times, the Teutons of old burst
upon the nations exposed to their onset<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c008'><sup>[446]</sup></a>. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>,
or price of blood, the earliest institution of
this race, only becomes perfectly intelligible when
considered from this point of view: the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gens</i></span> or family
at large are injured by the loss of their associate,
and to them compensation must be made;
so they, in turn, must make compensation for him,
since rights and duties are commensurate. This
principle, however darkly, is still involved in the
theory of our civil actions for seduction.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>It lies in the very nature of things that this, albeit
a natural, cannot be an enduring system. Its
principal condition is neighbourhood, the concentration
of the family upon one spot: as population
increases, and with it emigration, the family bond
gradually becomes weaker, and at last perishes as
a positive and substantive institution, surviving
only fragmentarily in the traces which it leaves
upon the latter order that replaces it. War, commerce,
cultivation,—the effect and cause of increasing
population,—gradually disperse the members
of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sibsceaft</i></span> or cognation, and a time arrives
when neighbours are no longer kinsmen. At this
point the old organization ceases to be effective,
and a new one becomes necessary, unless the ancient
principle is to be entirely abandoned. But
principles are not easily abandoned in early stages
of society; a young nation finds it easier to adopt
artificial arrangements founded upon the ancient
form: nor is it necessary that the later should have
totally superseded its predecessor; it is enough
that when the earlier ceases to fulfil its object, the
latter should be directed to supply its obvious deficiency,
and be united with it, as circumstances
best permit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout the earliest legislation of the Teutonic
nations, and especially in our own, we find
arrangements, based upon two distinct principles,
in active operation. The responsibility of the family
lies ever in the background, the ultimate
resort of the state against the individual, of the individual
against the state. But we also find small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>bodies of men existing as corporations, founded
upon number and neighbourhood, and thus making
up the public units in the state itself. From the
first, we find the inhabitants of the Mark classed
in tens and hundreds (technically in England, Tithings
and Hundreds) each probably comprising
respectively a corresponding number of members,
together with the necessary officers, viz. a tithing-man
for each tithing, and a hundred-man for the
hundred, thus making one hundred and eleven men,
or Heads of houses in the territorial hundred<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c008'><sup>[447]</sup></a>. The
Frankish law names the officers thus alluded to:
in it the tithing-man is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Decanus</i></span>, the hundred-man
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Centenarius</i></span><a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c008'><sup>[448]</sup></a>. The Anglosaxon law does not indeed
mention its divisions by these names till a comparatively
late period, when their significations had become
in some respects altered; but it seems probable
that it does imply them under the term Gegyldan,
<em>fellows, brothers of the gyld</em>. In a case of aggravated
crime it is provided that the offender’s relatives shall
pay a third part of the fine, his gegyldan a third
part, and if he cannot pay the remainder himself, he
is to become an outlaw, <i>i. e.</i> forfeit his land and flee,
perhaps formally abjure the country<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c008'><sup>[449]</sup></a>. Now it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>perfectly clear that a law expressed in such general
terms as these, cannot be directed to a particular
and exceptional condition; that it does not apply
to the accidental existence of gegyldan, but on the
contrary assumes every man to have such: we
cannot therefore construe it of voluntary associations
formed for religious, social or funereal objects<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c008'><sup>[450]</sup></a>,
and for the purposes of this law we must
look upon gegylda as a general name borne by
every individual in respect of some gyld or association
of which he was taken to be a member.
The only meanings which the root <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gyld</i></span> enables us
to attach to the word gegylda are these; either,
<em>one who shares with others in paying</em>; or, <em>one who
shares with others in worshipping</em>. If we adopt the
former rendering, we must suppose that certain contributions
were made by a number of persons to a
common purse, partly for festive purposes, partly
as a mutual guarantee and club-fund for legal costs,
for the expenses of reciprocal aid and defence, perhaps
even for mortuary celebrations and charitable
distributions. Another, though perhaps a less
probable, suggestion is that such gegyldan may
have been jointly responsible for taxes, or the outfit
of armed men who attended in the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>fyrd</i></span> or military
expedition, on behalf of them all. But this
we cannot further illustrate, in the absence of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>record of the financial system of the early Teutonic
monarchs, even those of Charlemagne himself, which
would have been invaluable guides to us through
the intricacies of that dark subject of enquiry. The
second meaning given to gegylda would rest upon
the assumption of some private and as it were hero-worship,
common to the gyld-brothers,—a fact familiar
enough to us in the Athenian φυλαι and
Roman <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gentes</i></span>; but the existence of any such foundation
for the gyld among the Anglosaxons is extremely
improbable, when we consider the small
numbers that appear to have constituted the association,
and that no trace of any such worship
remains in our heathen mythology<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c008'><sup>[451]</sup></a>. I therefore
prefer the first rendering of the word, and look upon
gegyldan as representing those who mutually pay
for one another; that is, under a system of pecuniary
mulcts, those who are mutually responsible
before the law,—the associates in the tithing and
the hundred.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well known that in the later Anglosaxon
law, and even to this day, the tithing and hundred
appear as local and territorial, not as numerical
divisions: we hear of tithings where there are more,
and tithings where there are fewer people; we are
told of the <em>spoor</em> of cattle being followed into one
hundred, or out of another<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c008'><sup>[452]</sup></a>. I do not deny that
in process of time these divisions had become territorial;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>but this does not of necessity invalidate the
doctrine that originally the numbers were calculated
according to the heads of families, or that the extent
of territory, and not the taxable, military or corporate
units, formed at first the varying quantity.
Had it been otherwise we should naturally have
found a much greater equality in the size of the
territorial hundreds throughout at least each Saxon
kingdom; nor in all probability would the numbers
of the hundreds in respective counties differ so
widely,—a difference intelligible only if we assume
population, and not space, to have been the basis of
the original calculation. Moreover to a very late
period, in one part of England the abstract word
Teoðung was replaced by the more concrete Tenmantale
(tyn-manna-tǽl)<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c008'><sup>[453]</sup></a>, to which it is impossible
to give any meaning but the simple one the words
express, viz. the tale or count of ten <em>men</em>. Again,
as late as the tenth century, in a part of England
where men, and not acres, became necessarily the
subjects of calculation, viz. in the city of London<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c008'><sup>[454]</sup></a>,
we find the citizens distributing themselves into
Friðgylds or associations for the maintenance of the
peace, each consisting of ten men; while ten such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>gylds were gathered into a Hundred. The remarkable
document known as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicia Civitatis Londinensis</span>”
gives the following detailed account of the
whole proceeding:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is the ordinance which the bishops and
the reeves belonging to London have ordained, and
confirmed with pledges, among our friðgylds, as
well eorlish as ceorlish, in addition to the dooms
which were fixed at Greatley, at Exeter, and at
Thundersfield.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Resolved: That we count every ten men together,
and the chief one to direct the nine in each
of those duties which we have all ordained, and
afterwards the hyndens of them together, and one
hynden-man who shall admonish the ten for our
common benefit; and let these eleven hold the
money of the hynden, and decide what they shall
disburse, when aught is to pay, and what they shall
receive, should money accrue to us at our common
suit<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c008'><sup>[455]</sup></a>....</p>

<p class='c001'>“That we gather to us once in every month, if
we can and have leisure, the hynden-men and those
who direct the tithings, as well with butt-filling, or
as else may please us, and know what of our agreement
has been executed. And let these twelve men<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c008'><sup>[456]</sup></a>
have their refection together, and feed themselves
as they themselves think right, and deal the remains
of the meat for love of God<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c008'><sup>[457]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Now as this valuable record mentions also territorial
tithings, containing different amounts of population<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c008'><sup>[458]</sup></a>,
it seems to me to furnish important confirmation
of the conclusion that the gegyldan of Ini
and Ælfred, the members of the London tithings
or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">friðgylds</span> of ten, and the York <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tenmantale</i></span>, are
in truth identical. And it is further in favour of
this view that the citizens called the members of
such gildships, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gegyldan</span><a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c008'><sup>[459]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we have also ordained, respecting every
man who has given his pledge in our gyldships,
that, should he die, each gyld-brother (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gegylda</span>)
shall give a gesufel-loaf for his soul, and sing a
fifty (psalms), or cause the same to be sung within
xxx days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon a review of the preceding passages it may
be inferred that the hynden consisted of ten tithings,
and consequently answered to what we more commonly
call a hundred: it may perhaps be suggested
that, if any distinction existed between these two
terms, the hynden represented the numerical, the
hundred the territorial division. But their original
identity may be argued from an important passage
in the law of Ini. He ordains<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c008'><sup>[460]</sup></a>: “He that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>charged with mortal feud, and is willing to deny the
slaying on oath; then shall there be in the hynden
one king’s oath of thirty hides, as well for a noble
as a churl, be it whichever it be.“</p>

<p class='c001'>Now hynden can only mean one of two things,
viz. a collection of ten or a collection of a hundred,
according as we render the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>hund</i></span>. Admitting
that at some very early period hund did mean ten,
we yet never find it with any such signification in
any book or MS., or indeed at all except in the numerals
hundseofontig, hundeatatig, hundnigontig,
hundtwelftig, where its force is anything but clear,
when we compare those words with fíftig, sixtig,
twentig, etc. On the other hand the adjective
hynde does clearly denote something which has
the quality of a hundred; thus a twyhynde or twelfhynde
man is he whose life is worth respectively two
or twelve <em>hundred</em> shillings. Again it is clear that
the Judicia Civitatis Londinensis intends by hynden
a collection of a hundred, and not of ten, men,
inasmuch as it distinguishes this from the tithings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>And further, it must be admitted, upon the internal
evidence of the law itself, that a hundred and not a
tithing is referred to, since so small a court as that
of the ten men could not possibly have had cognizance
of such a plea as manslaughter, or been competent
to demand a king’s oath of thirty hides.
But as such a plea might well be brought before
the hundred-court, it is probable that such was
meant. Lastly it was the custom for the hundred-court
to be holden monthly, and we observe the
same provision with the London hynden; at which
it is very probable that legal matters were transacted,
as well as accounts investigated; for it is
expressly declared that their meeting is to ascertain
how the undertakings in the record have been
executed; that is, how the peace has been kept. I
therefore conclude that the Hynden and the Hundred
are in fact and were at first identical; with
the hypothetical reservation, that at a later period
the one word represented a numerical, the other a
territorial division, when these two had ceased to
coincide: in corroboration of which view it may be
observed that the word Hynden does not occur in
the laws later than the time of Æðelstán, nor Hundred
earlier than that of Eádgár.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is true that no division founded upon numbers
can long continue to coincide with the first corresponding
territorial allocation, however closely
they may have been at first adjusted. In spite of
every attempt to regulate it, population varies incessantly;
but the tendency of land-divisions is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>remain stationary for ages<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c008'><sup>[461]</sup></a>; a holy horror prevents
the alteration of that which has been sanctified in
men’s minds by long continuance, was perhaps
more deeply sanctified at the first by religious ceremonies.
The rights of property universally demand
the jealous guardianship of boundaries. Moreover
the first tithings, or at all events the first hundreds,
must have had elbowroom enough within the Mark
to allow for a considerable elasticity of population
without the necessity of disturbing the ancient
boundary; and thus we can readily understand two
very distinct things to have grown up together,
out of one origin, namely a constantly increasing
number of gylds, yet a nearly or entirely stationary
tale of territorial tithings and hundreds. I cannot
but think that, under happier circumstances, this
view might lead us to conclusions of the utmost
importance with respect to the history of our race:
that if it were possible for us now to ascertain the
original number of hundreds in any county of which
Beda in the eighth century gives us the population,
and also the population at the period of the original
division, we should find the two data in exact accordance,
and thus obtain a clue to the movement
of the population itself down to Beda’s time. Looking
to the permanent character of land-divisions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>and assuming that our present Hundreds nearly
represent the original in number and extent, we
might conclude that, if in the year 400 Kent was
first divided, Thanet then contained only one hundred
heads of houses, or hydes, upon three thousand
acres of cultivated land, while in the time of
Beda, three centuries later, it comprised six hundred
families or hides upon eighteen thousand acres.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a common saying that we owe the institution
of shire, tithing and hundred divisions to
Ælfred. Stated in so broad a manner as this, I am
compelled to deny the assertion. No one can contemplate
the life and acts of that great prince and
accomplished man without being filled with admiration
and respect for his personal energy, his
moral and enlightened policy, and the sound legislative
as well as administrative principles on which
he acted. But we must nevertheless not in the
nineteenth century allow ourselves to be blinded
by the passions and prejudices which ruled in the
twelfth. The people, oppressed by foreign power,
no doubt, long looked back with an affectionate
regret to the memory of “England’s Darling;” he
was the hero of a suffering nation; his activity
and fortune had once cleared the land of Norman
tyranny; his arm had smitten the forefathers of
those whose iron yoke now weighed on England:
he was the reputed author of those laws, which,
under the amended and extended form enacted by
the Confessor, were now claimed by the English
people from their foreign kings: he was, in a word,
the representative, and as it were very incarnation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of English nationality. We may smile at, but must
yet respect, the feeling which made him also the
representative of every good thing, which connected
every institution or custom that his suffering countrymen
regretted, with his time-hallowed name. It
is unnecessary to detail the many ways in which
this traditional character of Ælfred continually reappears;
the object of these remarks is merely to
point out that the attribution to him of the system
of tithings, hundreds and the like, is one of many
groundless assertions connected with his name.
Not one word in corroboration of it is to be found
in Asser or any other contemporaneous authority;
and there is abundant evidence that the system
existed long before he was born, not only in other
German lands, but even among ourselves. Still I
am unwilling to incur the responsibility of declaring
the tradition absolutely without foundation:
on the contrary it seems probable that Ælfred may
have found it necessary, after the dreadful confusion
and devastation of the Danish wars, to make a
new muster or regulation of the tithings, nay even
to cause, in some districts, a new territorial division
to be established upon the old principle; and this
is the more credible, since there is reason to believe
that the same causes had rendered a new definition
of boundaries generally necessary even in the case
of private estates: the strongest argument against
this lies however in the total silence of all contemporary
writers. A less tenable supposition is, that
Ælfred introduced such divisions for the first time
into the countries which he united with Wessex; as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>it is impossible to conceive any Anglosaxon state
to have existed entirely without them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The form and nature of the institution, long
known in the English law under the name of Frankpledge<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c008'><sup>[462]</sup></a>
may be compendiously described in the
words of the laws called Edward the Confessor’s<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c008'><sup>[463]</sup></a>.
According to that document,—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another peace, the greatest of all, there is,
whereby all are maintained in firmer state, to wit
in the establishment of a guarantee, which the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>call Friðborgas, with the exception of the men
of York, who call it Tenmannetale, that is, the
number of ten men. And it consists in this, that
in all the vills throughout the kingdom, all men
are bound to be in a guarantee by tens, so that if
one of the ten men offend, the other nine may hold
him to right. But if he should flee, and they allege
that they could not have him to right, then should
be given them by the king’s justice a space of at
least thirty days and one: and if they could find
him they might bring him to justice. But for himself,
let him out of his own restore the damage he
had done, or if the offence be so grave let justice
be done upon his body. But if within the aforesaid
term he could not be found, since in every friðborh
there was one headman whom they called friðborg-heved,
then this headman should take two of the
best men of his friðborh, and the headman of each
of the three friðborgs most nearly neighbouring to
his own, and likewise two of the best in each, if he
can have them; and so with the eleven others he
shall, if he can, clear both himself and his friðborh
both of the offence and flight of the aforesaid malefactor.
Which if he cannot do, he shall restore
the damage done out of the property of the doer,
so long as this shall last, and out of his own and
that of his friðborh: and they shall make amends
to the justice according as it shall be by law adjudged
them. And moreover the oath which they
could not complete with the <em>venue</em>, the nine themselves
shall make, viz. that they had no part in the
offence. And if at any time they can recover him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>they shall bring him to the justice, if they can, or
tell the justice where he is<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c008'><sup>[464]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the object of the gylds or tithings was,
that each man should be in pledge or surety (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>borh</i></span>)
as well to his fellow-man as to the state for the
maintenance of the public peace: that he should
enjoy protection for life, honour and property himself,
and be compelled to respect the life, honour
and property of others: that he should have a fixed
and settled dwelling where he could be found when
required, where the public dues could be levied,
and the public services demanded of him: lastly
that, if guilty of actions that compromised the
public weal or trenched upon the rights and well-being
of others, there might be persons especially
appointed to bring him to justice; and if injured
by others, supporters to pursue his claim and exact
compensation for his wrong. All these points seem
to have been very well secured by the establishment
of the Tithings, to whom the community
looked as responsible for the conduct of every individual
comprised within them; and coupled with
the family obligations which still remained in force
in particular cases, they amply answered the purpose
of a mutual guarantee between all classes of
men. The system possessed the advantage of being
necessarily regulated by neighbourhood, and it was
free from some disadvantages which might have
attended an exclusive reliance upon kinsmanship:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frðiborgas</span> not having the bond of blood between
them, which might have induced an improper
partiality in favour of one of their members; and
as they stood under responsibility for every act of
a gyldsman, being interested in preventing an undue
interference on the part of his family. We thus
see that the gyldsmen were not only bound to present
their fellows before the court of the freemen
when specially summoned thereto, but that they
found their own advantage in exercising a kind of
police-surveillance over them all: if a crime were
committed, the gyld were to hold the criminal to his
answer; to clear him, if they could conscientiously
do so, by making oath in his favour; to aid in paying
his fine if found guilty; and if by flying from
justice he admitted his crime, they were to purge
themselves on oath from all guilty knowledge of the
act, and all participation in his flight; failing which,
they were themselves to suffer mulct in proportion
to his offence. On the other hand they were to
receive at least a portion of the compensation for
his death, or of such other sums as passed from
hand to hand during the progress of an Anglosaxon
suit. Being his neighbours, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>visnetum</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicinage</i></span>
or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>venue</i></span>, they were his natural compurgators or
witnesses, and consequently, being examined on
oath, in some sense the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>jurati</i></span> or <em>jurors</em> upon whose
verdict his weal or woe depended. And thus the
importance of character, so frequently appealed to
even in our modern jurisprudence, was carried to
the highest extent.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may reasonably conclude that the close intercourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>thus created, was improved to private
and social purposes, and that these gylds, like the
much larger associations of the same name in after
times, knew how to combine pleasure with business.
The citizens of London hint at a monthly <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>symposium</i></span>
or treat, with <em>butt-filling</em>, when the tithingmen
met together to settle the affairs of their respective
hundreds,—a trait not yet extinct in the
civic, or indeed the national, character. There can
also be little doubt that the gylds even formed
small courts of arbitration, as well as police, for the
settlement of such trifling disputes between members
of the same gyld, as were not worthy of being
reserved for the interference of a superior tribunal<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c008'><sup>[465]</sup></a>;
and it is also probable that the members considered
themselves bound to aid in the festivities or
do honour to the obsequies of any individual gyld-brother:
the London gyldsmen were to distribute
alms, and cause religious services to be performed
at the decease of a fellow; and it is obvious that
this sharing in a religious obligation, the benefits of
which were to extend even into another life, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>have impressed somewhat of a solemn and sacred
character upon the whole institution<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c008'><sup>[466]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much of what has been observed respecting the
tithing, applies also to the hundred. This, it has
been seen, was originally a collection of ten tithings,
and was presided over by a hundredes ealdor<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c008'><sup>[467]</sup></a>, or
hundred-man, who exercised a jurisdiction over his
circuit and its inhabitants. From the concurrent
practice of later periods we may conclude that his
court was holden monthly for the hearing of such
civil and lighter criminal causes as could not be
settled in the tithing, or interested more tithings
than one<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c008'><sup>[468]</sup></a>. It is not probable that the higher
criminal causes could at any period be pursued
in the hundred<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c008'><sup>[469]</sup></a>, but that they were necessarily
reserved for the consideration of the folcmót or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>shire-court, which met three times in the year. In
the later legislation, trial of capital offences was reserved
for the scyremót, and the words of Tacitus<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c008'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
seem to imply that this was the case in his time
also: perhaps even such causes as involved the
penalties of outlawry may have been beyond the jurisdiction
of the hundred. It is however less as a
court of justice than as part of a system for the maintenance
of peace, that we are to contemplate the
hundred. It may be securely affirmed that where
the tithing alone could not be made responsible, or
more tithings than one were involved in a similar
difficulty as to crimes committed by their members,
resort was had to the responsibility of the collective
hundred,—a principle which, it is well-known, subsists
even to this day.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a comparatively late period, we occasionally
find a consolidation of hundreds into one body, for
judicial purposes, presided over by the ealdorman
of the shire, or his geréfa, and forming a subsidiary
court to the shiremoot: and after immunities, or
private jurisdictions, had become rapidly extended,
it is certain that such consolidations were not unusual,
in the hands of great civil or ecclesiastical
authorities, and that they, by means of their officers
or geréfan, held plea in several hundreds at once;
they thus substituted their own power for that of
the ealdorman or the sheriff, in the last instance,
throughout the district comprehended by their immunity;
either replacing the old hundred-men by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>geréfan or bailiffs, or suffering the hundreds to be
still governed and administered in the way common
to all such divisions, by the elective officer<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c008'><sup>[471]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It stands to reason that the system above described
applied only to the really free. It was the
form of the original compact between the independent
members of an independent community.
But as by the side of the free landholders, there
dwelt also unfree men of various ranks, so also
there existed modifications of the original compact,
suited to their condition. Those who in a more or
less stringent degree were dependent, could not be
members of the tithing, the hundred or the folcmót.
They stood to right among themselves, in their
lord’s court, not in the people’s, and in the latter
they could not appear for themselves. The institution
therefore which provided that the lord might
maintain a Comitatus or <em>following</em>, provided also
that its members should all be in his mund (protection)
and borh (surety), and that he should make
answer for them in the courts from which they
were themselves excluded<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c008'><sup>[472]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>It is difficult to decide whether the lords or nobles
were at first comprised within the popular corporations:
it appears most probable that they were
not; that they were sufficient to their own defence,
and, even from the earliest historical periods, in
possession of that <em>immunity</em> which released their
lands from the jurisdiction of the popular tribunals.
In respect therefore to the gylds, they may be supposed
to have held an independent, though not
necessarily hostile, position, regulated indeed by the
public law: and if they stood to right with their
men, in the folcmót, it was the collective power
and dignity of the state with which they had to
deal, and not the smaller associations, founded
upon necessities of which they were not conscious.
Their dependents were under their guarantee and
surety, as the members of every man’s household,
his wife, children and serfs, were under <em>his</em>: for
them he was responsible to the community at large,
but he owed no suit or service to others, and if he
persisted in upholding wrong, I fear the only corrective
was to be found in the inalienable <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius belli</i></span>,
which resumes its power instantly upon the violation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>of that tacit understanding among men, that
the well-being of society depends upon a regulated
mutual forbearance. Those were not ages in which
acts of self-defence or righteous retribution could
be misnamed revolutions. But all these remarks
are intended to apply only to a state of society in
which the nobles were few and independent, the
people strong and united; where the people were
in truth the aristocracy<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c008'><sup>[473]</sup></a>, and the nobles only their
chiefs. The holder of an immunity (having sacn
and sócn) in later times, under a consolidated
royalty representing the national will, and in a
state from which the element of the people had
nearly vanished, through the almost total vanishing
of small independent freeholds, was necessarily
placed in a very different position.</p>

<p class='c001'>It now remains only to bestow a few words upon
the manner in which the original obligations of the
family bond were gradually brought to bear upon
the artificial organization.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon a careful consideration of the latter it appears
that its principal object was gained when
either offences were prevented, or the offender presented
to justice: the consequences of crime, in all
but a few excepted cases, fell not upon the gegyldan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>(if they could clear themselves of participation) but
upon the mǽgas or relatives<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c008'><sup>[474]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The laws of Æðelberht, Wihtræd and Hloðhere
know nothing of gegyldan: with them the mǽgas
are still wholly responsible, and even their intervention
is noticed in three cases only: Æðelberht
provided that in the event of a manslayer flying
the country, the family should pay half the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
of the slain<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c008'><sup>[475]</sup></a>. Again he enacts, that if a married
woman die without bearing children, the property
she brought her husband, and that which he settled
upon her after consummation, shall return to her
paternal relatives<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c008'><sup>[476]</sup></a>. According to the legislation of
Hloðhere, if a man died, leaving a wife and child,
the mother was to have the custody of the child till
his tenth year, but the paternal kinsmen were to
administer his property, under satisfactory pledge
for due discharge of their duty<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c008'><sup>[477]</sup></a>. The regulations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of Ini allow us to enter still further into the nature
of the family engagement. He enacted that if a
stranger came through the wood out of the highway,
and attempted to slink through in secret,
without shouting or blowing his horn, he should be
taken to be a thief, and might be slain or forced to
pay according to his presumed crime: and if the
slayer were then pursued for his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, he might
make oath that he slew him for a thief, and the lord
and the gegyldan of the dead man should not be
allowed to make oath to the contrary: but if the
slayer had at the time concealed the deed, and it
was only afterwards discovered, a presumption of
unfair dealing was raised against him, and the kindred
of the dead man were entitled to make oath of
his innocence<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c008'><sup>[478]</sup></a>. Again if a stranger were slain, the
king was to have two parts of his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, the son
or relatives of the dead man might claim the third;
but if there were no relatives, the king claimed
half, the count half<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c008'><sup>[479]</sup></a>. Besides a provision for a surviving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>child, similar to that of Hloðhere<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c008'><sup>[480]</sup></a>, the law
of Ini contains no further regulation with regard
to the mǽgas of the freeman. Four several chapters
referring to serfs who are guilty of theft, rest
upon the principle that his kin have renounced the
mǽgburh by suffering him to remain in serfage,
and together with the obligations of kinsman have
relinquished their own right of avenging his injuries
or making pursuit for his wrongs<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c008'><sup>[481]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The duties of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mǽgsceaft</span> or kinship are developed
with considerable detail in the law of Ælfred:
the most general regulation is that which acknowledges
the right of a man to have the aid of his kindred
in all those excepted cases where the custom
and the law still permitted the waging of fǽhðe or
private war: “After the same fashion, may a man
fight on behalf of his born kinsman, if any wrongfully
attack him; except indeed against his lord:
that we permit not<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c008'><sup>[482]</sup></a>.” Other clauses provide that
where a wrongdoer is taken into custody, and agrees
peaceably to abide the decision of the law, his relatives
shall have due notice<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c008'><sup>[483]</sup></a>: “If he pledge himself
to a lawful act, and belie himself therein, let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>him humbly surrender his arms and his goods to
his friends, to hold for him, and let him remain for
forty days in prison in a king’s tún; let him there
suffer as the bishop may direct him; and let his
kinsmen feed him, if he have himself no food; but
if he have no kinsmen, or no food, let the king’s
reeve feed him.” Again if a man is accidentally
slain while hewing wood with others, his kinsmen
are to have the tree, and remove it from the land
within thirty days, otherwise it shall go to the
owner of the wood<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c008'><sup>[484]</sup></a>. The most important case of
all, however, is that of a divided responsibility between
the kinsmen and the gegyldan, which Ælfred
thus regulates: “If one that hath no paternal kindred
fight and slay a man, if then he have maternal
relatives, let them pay a third part of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span>, his
gyldbrethren a third part, and for a third part let
him flee. If he have no maternal relatives, let his
gyldbrethren pay half, and for half let him flee.
And if any one slay such a man, having no relatives,
let half be paid to the king, half to the gyldbrethren<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c008'><sup>[485]</sup></a>.”
It was also the principle of Ælfred’s
law, recognized but not introduced by him, that
no man should have the power of alienating from
his mǽgsceaft, booklands whose first acquirer had
entailed them upon the family,—a principle which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>tends, as far as human means seem capable of ensuring
it, to ensure its permanent maintenance<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c008'><sup>[486]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reciprocal rights and duties of the mǽgburh
were similarly understood by Eádweard: he enacted
that if a malefactor were deserted by his relatives,
and they refused to make compensation for him,
he should be reduced to serfage; but in this case
his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> was to abate from the kindred<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c008'><sup>[487]</sup></a>. And
Æðelstan distinctly holds the mǽgð responsible
for their kinsman. He says, “If a thief be put
into prison, let him remain there forty days, and
then let him be ransomed for 120 shillings, and let
the kindred go surety for him that he shall cease
from theft for the future. And if after that he
steal, let them pay for him with his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, or
replace him in prison<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c008'><sup>[488]</sup></a>.” But he goes further than
this, and imposes upon them the duty of finding a
lord for him, or exposing him to the penalty of
outlawry: “And we have ordained respecting those
lordless men of whom no law can be got, that the
kindred be commanded to domicile him to folkright,
and find him a lord in the folkmote; and if
then they will not or cannot produce him at the
term, let him thenceforth be an outlaw, and let
whoso cometh at him slay him<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c008'><sup>[489]</sup></a>:” a provision which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>obviously cannot apply to free landowners, who
would have been included in a tithing, and could
not have been thus compulsorily commended to a
lord. Where a man is slain as a thief, the relatives
are to clear him, if they can<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c008'><sup>[490]</sup></a>, inasmuch as they
would have a right to pursue the slayer and claim
the compensation for their kinsman’s death. Again
it is provided that if a lord has so many dependents
that he cannot personally exercise a due supervision
over them, he shall appoint efficient reeves or bailiffs
in his several manors, to be answerable to him.
And if need be, the bailiff shall cause twelve relatives
of any man whom he cannot trust, to enter
into sureties for him<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c008'><sup>[491]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eádmund permitted the mǽgð to avoid the consequences
of their kinsman’s act, by refusing to abet
him in his feud<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c008'><sup>[492]</sup></a>. I imagine that this law must be
taken in connection with that of Eádweard<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c008'><sup>[493]</sup></a>, and
that it implies a total desertion of the criminal by
his kindred, with all its consequences, viz. loss of
liberty to him, and of his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> to them. The
troubled time of Æðelred, “the ill-advised,” supplies
another attempt to secure peace by holding the
relatives strictly and personally responsible: in his
law we find it enacted, “If breach of the peace be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>committed within a town, let the inhabitants of the
town go in person, and take the murderers, alive or
dead, or their nearest of kin, head for head. If
they will not, let the ealdorman go; if he will not,
let the king go; if he will not, let the whole district
be in a state of war<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c008'><sup>[494]</sup></a>.” Though this perhaps is
less a settled rule of law than the convulsive effort
of an authority striving in vain to maintain itself
amid civil discords and the horrors of foreign invasion,
it still consecrates the old principle, and
returns to the true basis on which Anglosaxon
society was founded, namely treaties of peace and
mutual guarantee between the several parties that
made up the State.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such were the means by which the internal peace
of the land was attempted to be secured, and it is
evident that better could hardly have been devised
in a state of society where population was not very
widely dispersed, and where property hardly existed,
save in land, and almost equally unmanageable
cattle. The summary jurisdiction of our police
magistrates, our recognizances and bail and binding
over to keep the peace, are developments rendered
necessary by our altered circumstances; but
these are nevertheless institutions of the same nature
as those on which our forefathers relied. The
establishment of our County-courts, in which justice
goes forth from man to man, and without original
writ from the Crown, is another step toward
the ancient principle of our jurisprudence, in the
old Hundred.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>A further inquiry now arises, as to the basis upon
which all calculations as to satisfaction between
man and man were founded; in other words to the
system of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wergylds</span> and its various corollaries:
this will form the subject of a separate chapter.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f446'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r446'>446</a>. Weight and momentum combined are the secret of modern tactics,
and <em>morally speaking</em> (i. e. the appearance in superior force on certain
points), of modern strategics also. Cavalry charging in successive echelons
would always break infantry but for the check which man and
horse experience in their speed from the file-firing of the squares: the
mere weight of the horse <em>falling dead into the first rank</em> would break
it if he reached it. If the weight of the advancing body be greater than
that of the resisting, the latter is destroyed. A successful charge of
cavalry won the battle of Marengo, an unsuccessful one lost that of
Waterloo. Modern warfare was more changed by the substitution of
iron for wooden ramrods, by which the momentum of musket-balls was
increased, than by almost any other mere change of detail. Steam-carriages
and scythe-chariots, the Macedonian phalanx—nay, even
squadrons of horse, are only <em>larger bullets</em>, which may be launched
with more or less success: all these are mechanical discoveries consequent
upon the fact that the individuals of which armies are composed
are lower in the scale of moral dignity than of old. Once group men
in masses, and they become subject, more or less, according as discipline
has destroyed their individuality, to the mechanical laws which
govern the relations of all masses. No doubt a stone wall will turn
any charge of cavalry; and so will a regiment of infantry, in exact proportion
as you teach it to stand like a stone wall, that is, as you destroy
the individual action of each soldier. The Romans stood above two
feet apart; our men touch each other at the elbows. Our armies
are fitter perhaps for aggressive movements. The Germans probably
charged tumultuously; but the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">scyldburh</span>, or <em>wall of shields</em>, was hardly
less capable of receiving a charge than our own squares.</p>

conclusion: “It has been already observed that the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hynden</span> consisted
of ten persons, and, like <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hynde</span> in the words <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">twýhynde, sixhynde, twelfhynde</span>,
appears to have been formed from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hund</span>, of which the original
meaning was <em>ten</em>. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hynden</span> therefore will correspond to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>turba</i></span>
of the Civil Law (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quia Turba decem dicuntur.</span>’ Leg. Præt. 4. § Turbam),

par deux tourbes et chacun d’icelles par dix temoins.'</span> Loisel. liv. v.
tit. 5. c. 13.” But the correspondence noted will entirely depend upon
the fact of the hynden really being a collection of ten men, which I do
not admit. There is no dispute as to the meaning of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Turba</i></span> or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Tourbe</i></span>:
but if, as it is not impossible, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>turba</i></span> should be really identical with <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þorp</span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vicus</i></span>, it might deserve consideration whether the original village was
not supposed to consist of ten families and so to form the tithing or

<div class='footnote' id='f463'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r463'>463</a>. This is given here only as the most detailed account: the principle
was as old as the Anglosaxon monarchy itself, or older. The law of
Eádgár thus expresses it: “Let every man so order, that he have a
surety, and let the surety (c) bring and hold him to every right;
and if any one then offend and escape, let the surety bear what he
ought to bear. But if it be a thief, and the surety can get hold of him
within twelve months, let him surrender the thief to justice, and let
what he before paid be restored to him.” Eádg. ii. § 6. Thorpe, i. 268.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This then is my will, that every man be in surety, both within the
towns and without the towns.” Eádg. ii. supp. § 3. Thorpe, i. 274.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let every freeman have a true <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>borh</i></span>, who may present him to every
right, should he be accused.” Æðelred, i. § 1. Thorpe, i. 280.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he flee from the ordeal, let the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>borh</i></span> pay for him according to
his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span>.” Æðelr. iii. § 6. Thorpe, i. 296.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we will that every freeman be brought into a hundred and into
a tithing, who desires to be entitled to <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>lád</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span>, in case any one
should slay him after he have reached the age of xii years: or let him

<p class='c001'>The stranger or friendless man, who had no <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>borh</i></span>, i. e. could not

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER X. <br /> FǼHÐE. WERGYLD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The right of private warfare, technically called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fǽhðe</span>
or <em>feud</em><a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c008'><sup>[495]</sup></a>, was one which every Teutonic freeman
considered inalienable; and which, coupled with
the obligations of family, was directly derived from
his original position as a freeman<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c008'><sup>[496]</sup></a>: it was the privilege
which he possessed before he consented to
enter into any political bond, the common term
upon which all freemen could meet in an equal
form of polity. It was an immediate corollary from
that primæval law of nature, that each man may
provide for his own defence, and use his own energies
to secure his own well-being, and the quiet
possession of his life, his liberty and the fruits of
his labour. History and tradition both assure us
that it did exist among the tribes of the North:
and it is reasonable to suppose that it must have
done so, especially in any case where we can conceive
separate families and households to have maintained
at all an independent position toward one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>another. Where no <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>imperium</i></span> yet exists, society itself
possesses only a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ius belli</i></span> against its own several
members; and if neighbours will not be neighbourly,
they must be coerced into peace (the great
and first need of all society and the condition of its
existence) by alliance of the many against the few,
of the orderly and peaceful against the violent and
lawless. This right of feud then lies at the root
of all Teutonic legislation; and in the Anglosaxon
law especially it continues to be recognized long
after an imperial power has been constituted, and
the general conservancy of the peace has been committed
to a central authority. It admits as its most
general term, that each freeman is at liberty to defend
himself, his family and his friends; to avenge
all wrongs done to them, as to himself shall seem
good; to sink, burn, kill and destroy, as amply as
a royal commission now authorizes the same in a
professional class, the recognized executors of the
national will in that behalf. Now it is obvious
that such a power, exercised in its full extent, must
render the formation of an orderly society difficult,
if not impossible. The first problem then is to devise
means by which private vengeance may be
regulated, private wrong atoned, the necessity of
each man’s doing himself right avoided, and the
general state of peace and security provided for.
For setting aside the loss to the whole community
which may arise from private feud, the moral sense
of men may be shocked by its results: an individual’s
own estimate of the satisfaction necessary
to atone for the injury done to him, may lead to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>the commission of a wrong on his part, greater than
any he hath suffered; nor can the strict rule of “an
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,” be applied,
where the exaction of the penalty depends upon the
measure of force between appellant and defender.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the feeling then of the omnipotence of the
State, for paramount purposes, over all the several
individuals whose proximity to one another necessarily
caused the existence between them of relations,
amicable or hostile, the Teutonic nations set
themselves the task of regulating the <em>Right of Feud</em>.
They could not entirely abrogate it, for it was the
very basis of that freedom which enabled every man
to enter into a contract or engagement as to the
mode of its exercise; but they defined, and as far
as possible limited, its sphere and the extent of its
action.</p>

<p class='c001'>The natural right of every man to do himself
justice to the extent of his own estimate<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c008'><sup>[497]</sup></a>, seems
early to have received so much check as could be
given by the establishment of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lex talionis</i></span>,—life
for life, and limb for limb. The eorl who captured
the thane Imma, in the seventh century, could say
to him, “I might justly put thee to death, because
my kinsmen fell in the battle wherein thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>wert made prisoner<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c008'><sup>[498]</sup></a>;” and this principle was recognized
even in the later legislation, after what
we may call a legal commutation of this right had
been established: the ordinance respecting oaths
to be administered says, “A twelfhynde man’s
oath stands for six ceorls’ oaths; because if a man
should avenge a twelfhynde man, he will be fully
avenged on six ceorls, and his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> will be six
ceorls’ <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergylds</span><a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c008'><sup>[499]</sup></a>.” The Teutonic nations generally
avoided the inconveniences of such a system by
making the State itself the arbitrator between the
parties; that is, by establishing a tariff at which injuries
should be rated, and committing to the State
the duty of compelling the injured person to receive,
and the wrongdoer to pay, the settled amount. It
thus engaged to act as a mediator between the
conflicting interests, with a view to the maintenance
of the general peace: it assured to the sufferer the
legal satisfaction for his loss; it engaged to his
adversary that, upon due payment of that legal
satisfaction, he should be placed under the public
guarantee and saved from all the consequences of
feud. For doing this, the State claimed also some
remuneration; it imposed a fine, called sometimes
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fredum</i></span>, from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frið</span>, peace, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bannum</i></span> from its proclamation
(bannan)<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c008'><sup>[500]</sup></a>, over and above the compensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>between man and man. And this is obviously
what Tacitus means when he says<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c008'><sup>[501]</sup></a>, “They are
bound to take up both the enmities and the friendships
of a father or relative. Nor are their enmities
implacable; for even homicide is atoned for by
a settled number of flocks or cattle, and the whole
house receives satisfaction,—a useful thing for the
state, for feuds are dangerous in exact proportion
to freedom.” And again, “A portion of the fine
goes to the king or state, a part to him whose damages
are to be assessed, or to his relatives.” Only
where the State would not, or could not, as may
sometimes have happened, undertake this duty, did
the right of private warfare again resume its course,
and the family relations recover their pristine importance.
The man who presumes to fight, before
he has in vain appealed to all the recognized authorities
for redress, is liable, under Ælfred’s law,
to severe punishment, except in one important
case, which involved the maintenance of the family
itself, to secure which alone the machinery of the
State exists<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c008'><sup>[502]</sup></a>. But where the offender refuses to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>avail himself of the means of peaceful settlement
which society has provided for him, the person injured
may make war upon him, and have the assistance
of the State in so doing. The most general
expression of this right is found in a proverbial
formula retained in the law of Eádweard the Confessor,
and which may be said to comprise all the
law of the subject: it says, “Let amends be made
to the kindred, or let their war be borne;” whence
the English had the proverb, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">‘Bicge spere of síde
óðer bere,’</span> that is to say, <em>Buy off the spear or bear
it</em><a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c008'><sup>[503]</sup></a>. The mode however of applying this general
right was not left to individual caprice. The following
regulations made by successive kings will
explain very fully the practice and the theory of
Feud or War. Ælfred ordains, “That the man who
knows his foe to be homesitting fight not, before
he have demanded justice of him. If he have
power enough to beset his foe, and besiege him in
his house, let him keep him there for seven days, but
not attack him, if he will remain within-doors. If
then, after seven days, he be willing to surrender,
and to give up his weapons, let him be kept safe
for thirty days, and let notice of him be given
to his kinsmen and friends.... But if the plaintiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>have not power enough of his own to besiege his
foeman, let him ride to the ealdorman and beg aid
of him: and if the ealdorman will not aid him, let
him ride to the king before he fights. In like manner
if a man come accidentally upon his foe, and
without previous knowledge of his homestaying; if
the foe will surrender his weapons, let him be kept
safely for thirty days, and let notice be given to his
friends. If he will not surrender his weapons, he
may lawfully be attacked. But if he be willing to
surrender and to deliver up his weapons, and after
that, any one attack him, let him pay <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span> and
wound, as well he may, and fine, and have forfeited
his mǽgship<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c008'><sup>[504]</sup></a>. We also declare that it is lawful
war, for a man to fight for his lord, if any one
attack his lord: and so also may the lord fight for
his man. And in like manner a man may fight
for his born kinsman, if any wrongfully attack
him, except against his own lord: that we allow
not. And it is lawful war if a man find another
with his wedded wife within closed doors, or under
one covering, or with his daughter born in wedlock,
or his sister born in wedlock, or his mother who
was given to his father as a wedded wife<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c008'><sup>[505]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The inconveniences of this state of society induced
Eádmund, about the middle of the tenth century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>to release the kindred from the consequences
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fǽhðe</span>: he thus commences his secular laws:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eádmund the king makes known to all the
people, old and young, that are in his dominion,
what I have deliberated with the counsel of my
Witan, both ordained and laic. First how I might
best promote Christianity. Then seemed it to us
first most needful that we should most firmly preserve
peace and harmony among ourselves, throughout
all my dominion. Both I, and all of us, hold
in horror the unrighteous and manifold fightings
that exist among ourselves: we have therefore decreed:
If henceforth any one slay another, let him
bear the feud himself, unless by the assistance of
his friends, and within twelve months, he make
amends with the full <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span>, be he born as he may.
But if his kindred forsake him, and will not pay for
him, it is my will that all the kindred be <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>unfáh</i></span> [out
of feud] except the actual perpetrator; provided
that they do not give him either food or protection.
But if afterwards any of the kindred harbour him,
he shall be liable in all that he possesses to the
king<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c008'><sup>[506]</sup></a> and bear the feud with the kindred, because
they had previously forsaken him. But if any of
the other kindred take vengeance upon any man
save the actual perpetrator, let him be foe to the
king and all his friends, and forfeit all that he
has<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c008'><sup>[507]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>It is probable that this right thus reserved to the
kindred of deserting their guilty kinsman, was not
often exercised, nevertheless the subsequent laws
of Æðelred and Cnut<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c008'><sup>[508]</sup></a> may be considered to have
been understood in connexion with it, and subject
to its limitations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The law of Eádweard the elder (about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 900 to
915), regulates the mode of proceeding when both
parties are willing to forego the feud, upon the established
principles of compensation. He says<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c008'><sup>[509]</sup></a>: “The
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of a twelfhynde man is twelve hundred
shillings. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of a twýhynde man is two
hundred shillings. If any one be slain, let him be
paid for according to his birth. And it is the law,
that, after the slayer has given pledge for the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>,
he should find in addition a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>werborh</i></span>, according
to the circumstances of the case; that is, for
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of a twelfhynde man, the werborh
must consist of twelve men, eight by the father’s,
four by the mother’s side. When that is done,
let the king’s protection be set up; that is, all, of
either kindred, laying their hands together upon one
weapon, shall pledge themselves to the mediator,
that the king’s protection shall stand. In twenty-one
days from that day let one hundred and twenty
shillings be paid as <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>healsfang</i></span>, at a twelfhynde man’s
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>. The healsfang belongs to the children,
brothers and paternal uncles: that money belongs
to no kinsman except such as are within the degrees
of blood. Twenty-one days after the healsfang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>is paid, let the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>manbót</i></span> be paid; twenty-one days
later, the <em>fight-fine</em>; in twenty-one days from this,
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>frumgyld</i></span> or first instalment of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>; and
so forth until the whole sum be discharged at such
fixed time as the Witan have agreed. After this
they may depart with love, if they desire to have
full friendship. And with respect to the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
of a ceorl, all that belongs in his condition shall be
done in like manner as we have said respecting the
twelfhynde man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The law of Eádmund contains similar provisions<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c008'><sup>[510]</sup></a>.
“The Witan shall appease feud. First, according
to folkright, the slayer shall give pledge to his advocate,
and the advocate to the kindred of the slain,
that the slayer will make compensation to the kin.
Then it is necessary that security be given to the
slayer’s advocate, that the slayer may draw nigh in
peace, and himself give pledge for the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>.
When he has given his wed for this, let him further
find a werborh, or security for the payment of the
wer. When that is done let the king’s protection
be set up: within twenty-one days from that, let the
healsfang be paid; within other twenty-one <a id='corr276.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dasy'>days</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_276.23'><ins class='correction' title='dasy'>days</ins></a></span>,
the manbót; and twenty-one days from that, the
first instalment of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> then, or life-price, was the basis
upon which all peaceful settlement of feud was
established. A sum paid either in kind or in
money, where money existed, was placed upon the
life of every free man, according to his rank in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>state, his birth or his office. A corresponding sum
was settled for every wound that could be inflicted
upon his person; for nearly every injury that could
be done to his civil rights, his honour or his domestic
peace; and further fines were appointed according
to the peculiar, adventitious circumstances
that might appear to aggravate or extenuate the
offence. From the operation of this principle no
one was exempt, and the king as well as the peasant
was protected by a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, payable to his
kinsmen and his people. The difference of the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
is the principal distinction between different
classes; it defined the value of each man’s oath,
his mund or protection, and the amount of his fines
or his exactions: and, as we have already seen<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c008'><sup>[511]</sup></a>, it
regulated the equivalent for his value. And as it
is obvious that the simple <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of the free man
is the original unit in the computation, we have a
strong argument, were any needed, that that class
formed the real basis and original foundation of all
Teutonic society.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this principle was common to all the
Germanic tribes, very great variety exists in the
amounts severally adopted to represent the value of
different ranks,—a variety easily understood when
we reflect upon the relative condition of those tribes
at the period when this portion of their law was
first settled. A slight account of them will be useful,
as an introduction to the consideration of our
Anglosaxon values. It will be seen throughout that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>various circumstances have tended to introduce
changes into the early and simple order<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c008'><sup>[512]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Salian Franks.—Ingenuus, 200 sol.: litus, 100
sol.: ingenuus in hoste 600: litus in hoste, 300 sol.:
ingenuus in truste 1800: litus in truste, 900 sol.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus if engaged in actual warfare, the value of
the freeman and the emancipated serf was tripled;
and if in the <em>trust</em> or immediate service of the king,
their respective values were multiplied nine times.
It is probable that the Ripuarian Franks adopted
the same numbers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Angli et Werini.—Liber 200 sol.: adaling (noble)
600: libertus (freedman) 80 sol.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Saxons.—Probably, the freeman 240
shillings: noble 1440: freedman 120 shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Bavarians.—The duke 960 shillings:
the ducal family of the Agilolfings, 640: the other
five noble races, 320 shillings: the simple free man
160 shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Alamanni.—Primus (the first rank of
the nobles) 240 shillings: medianus (the second
rank of nobles) 200: minofledus (the free man)
160.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Burgundians.—Noble 300 shillings:
lower noble (mediocris) 200: freeman (minor) 150.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Frisians.—Noble 80 shillings: freeman
53⅓; freedman 26⅔ shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Law of the Visigoths.—Freeman (between the
years of twenty and fifty) 300 shillings: freedman
150.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>In the North, 100 silfrs was the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of the
freeman, and there is no account of the jarl’s. The
Old Swedish laws generally assign 40 marks; this
is the reckoning of the Upland, Sudermanland,
and Eastgothland laws. The Westgothland law has
39 marks; the Jutish 54; and the Gutalag, three
marks of gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of the clergy is slightly different:
among the Salic Franks, deacon 300, priest 600,
bishop 900 shillings. A late addition to the Ripuarian
law computes,—clericus 200, subdeacon
400, deacon 500, priest 600, bishop 900.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is sufficient to give a general outline of the
system: it will be observed that these continental
computations give no reckoning for the king. Beyond
doubt they were for the most part settled after
the royal power had become so fully developed as
to cast aside all traces of its original character and
nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Anglosaxon equivalents for these computations
are by no means clear; nor, as far as we can
judge, are they altogether consistent. It is probable
that they varied not only in the several Anglosaxon
kingdoms, but were also subject to change at various
periods, as the relative value of life and produce
altered. The Kentish law which names only
the eorl and ceorl, as the two classes of free men,
does not give us the exact amount of their <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergylds</span>,
but it supplies us with some data by which
perhaps an approximation may be made to it. In
Æðelberht’s law (§ 2, 5, 8) the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><em>mundbyrd</em></span>
or protection is valued at fifty shillings, the eorl’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>or noble’s at twelve (§ 13, 14, compared with § 10,
15, 16, 17), and the ceorl’s or simple freeman’s at
six (§ 15, 25, 88). Thus the three classes stand in
the relation of fifty, twelve and six; or taking the
ceorl as unity, their respective values are 8⅓, 2 and
1: that is,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ceorl:eorl::1:2.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ceorl:king::1:8⅓.</div>
      <div class='line'>Eorl :king::1:4⅙.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>medume leódgeld</i></span> of the ceorl is stated to
be one hundred shillings (§ 7), and if Grimm and
Thorpe were right in translating this the <em>half</em> <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>,
we should have the very improbable sums of
200, 400 and 1666⅓ Kentish shillings. <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Meduma</i></span>
however does not signify <em>half</em>, but <em>middling</em>, <em>moderate</em>:
the enactment in Æðelberht’s law amounts
in fact to this: If a man slay another, he is to
pay his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>; but not so, if the slayer happen
to be the king’s armourer or messenger; in that
case he is to pay only a moderated <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of one
hundred shillings. It was an exemption in favour
of two most important officers of the royal household;
and shows partly the growing encroachment
of prerogative, partly the value set upon the
talents of the officers themselves<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c008'><sup>[513]</sup></a>. The common
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> then was above one hundred, and I think
it can be shown that it was below two hundred,
shillings. The case of a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> paid for a king,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>though rare, is by no means unexampled<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c008'><sup>[514]</sup></a>. In
the year 687, Múl Æðelweard, a scion of the royal
race of Wessex, invaded Kent, and having incautiously
suffered himself to be surprised by the
country-people, was burnt to death in a house where
he had taken refuge with a few comrades. Seven
years later the men of Kent made compensation to
Ini for Múl’s death. The sum given is very variously
stated. William of Malmesbury says it was
thirty thousand mancuses<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c008'><sup>[515]</sup></a>; which, calculated at
eight mancuses to the pound, would be three thousand,
seven hundred and fifty pounds, and this
is the sum mentioned by Florence of Worcester<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c008'><sup>[516]</sup></a>.
Æðelweard, the oldest Latin chronicler, but still
removed four centuries from the time, makes it
amount to thirty thousand solidi or shillings, each
of which is to be calculated at sixteen pence<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c008'><sup>[517]</sup></a>. Some
manuscripts of the Saxon Chronicle read thirty
thousand pounds<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c008'><sup>[518]</sup></a>, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þrittig þusend punda,</span>”—others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>thirty pounds, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þrittig punda.</span>” Now however contradictory
all these statements may at first sight
appear (and there can be no doubt that some of them
are ridiculously exaggerated), it is not impossible
to reconcile and explain them. Every one of the
authorities I have cited, except Florence, who has
evidently calculated his sum upon what he believed
to be the value of the mancus, reads thirty thousand
of some coin or other. One will have them pounds,
another shillings, another mancuses, etc. Now
they are all wrong in their denomination, and all
equally right in their number; and for this very
obvious reason,—the originals from which they derived
their information did mention the number,
and did not mention the denomination. Each author
put the question to himself, “Thirty thousand
<em>what</em>?” and answered it by supplying the supposed
omission with the coin most familiar to himself.
But there cannot be the least doubt that the Saxon
original read <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þrittig þusenda</span>, thirty thousand, and
nothing else; and this is not only actually the reading
of some MSS. of the Chronicle, but most likely
the cause of the error which lies in the other copies,
incautious transcribers having been misled by the
resemblance between the Saxon þ and <i>p</i> and mistaken
the contraction <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þrittig þūnda</span> for <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þrittig punda</span>,
thirty pounds. It is the custom of the Anglosaxon
tongue, in describing measures of land or
sums of money, to use the numerals only, leaving
the commonest units to be supplied by the reader.
Thus if land were intended, thirty thousand would
denote that number of <em>hides</em>; and where money is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>intended, at least in Kent, thirty thousand <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>scæts</i></span><a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c008'><sup>[519]</sup></a>.
This then I believe to have been the sum paid to
Ini, and the regular personal <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of a Kentish
king. Let us now apply this sum to elucidate the
value of the other Kentish <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergylds</span>. From a comparison
of the compensation appointed for injuries
done to the nails of the fingers and toes, Mr.
Thorpe, the late Mr. Allen, and I concluded that
the value of a Kentish shilling was twenty scæts.
But thirty thousand scæts would be fifteen hundred
such shillings, and assuming this to be the royal
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, we shall find the eorl’s to be 360, the
ceorl’s 180 shillings, which amounts are exactly
thirty times the value of the several mundbyrds<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c008'><sup>[520]</sup></a>.
In the first volume of Mr. Thorpe’s Anglosaxon
Laws, at p. 186, there is a document which professes
to give the values of different classes in
Northumberland. Its date is uncertain, though it
appears to have been generally assigned to the commencement
of the tenth century. I confess that I
can hardly reconcile myself to so early a date, and
think it altogether a suspicious authority. It tells
us as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>“1. The Northpeople’s royal gyld is thirty thousand
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>thrymsas</i></span>; fifteen thousand thrymsas are for
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, and fifteen thousand for the royal dignity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span> belongs to the kindred; the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>cynebót</i></span>
to the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>“2. An archbishop’s and an æðeling’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
is fifteen thousand thrymsas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“3. A bishop’s and an ealdorman’s, eight thousand
thrymsas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“4. A hold’s and a king’s high reeve’s, four
thousand thrymsas,</p>

<p class='c001'>“5. A mass thane’s and a secular thane’s, two
thousand thrymsas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“6. A ceorl’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> is two hundred and sixty-six
thrymsas, that is two hundred shillings by Mercian
law.</p>

<p class='c001'>“7. And if a Welshman thrive so well that he
have a hide of land, and can bring forth the king’s
tax, then is his <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> one hundred and twenty
shillings; and if he thrive not save to half a hide,
then let his wer be eighty shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“8. And if he have not any land, but yet is free,
let him be paid for with seventy shillings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“9. And if a ceorlish man thrive so well that
he have five hides of land for the king’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>útware</i></span>,
and any one slay him, let him be paid for with two
thousand thrymsas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“10. And though he thrive so that he have a
helm and coat-of-mail, and a sword ornamented
with gold, if he have not that land, he is notwithstanding
a ceorl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“11. And if his son and his son’s son so thrive
that they have so much land after him, the offspring
shall be of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gesíðcund</span> [noble] race at two
thousand.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“12. And if they have not that, nor to that
amount can thrive, let them be paid for as ceorlish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another, and perhaps more trustworthy document,
printed at p. 190 of the same volume, gives
us the following values as current in Mercia.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A ceorl’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> is by Mercian law, two hundred
shillings. A thane’s <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> is six times as
much, that is, twelve hundred shillings. Then is
a king’s simple <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>, six thanes’ wer by Mercian
law, that is thirty thousand sceats and that is
altogether one hundred and twenty pounds. So
much is the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> in the folkright by Mercian
law. And for the royal dignity such another sum
is due, as compensation for cynegyld. The <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wer</i></span> belongs
to the kindred, the cynebót to the people.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A passage already cited in this chapter gives the
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergylds</span> of the freeman and noble in Wessex as
respectively two hundred and twelve hundred scillingas,
whence those classes are called twýhynde
and twelfhynde: these denominations correspond
to the old and usual ceorl and eorl; and as the
original expression for all classes of society was,
<em>be it churl, be it earl</em>, Cnut could use as perfectly
equivalent, <em>be it twýhynde, be it twelfhynde</em><a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c008'><sup>[521]</sup></a>. But
in Wessex a third class is mentioned, whose <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span>
was half that of the twelfhynde, and three
times that of the ceorl: they are called sixhynde,
men of six hundred. It is difficult to say whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>they are the original nobles, three times as valuable
as the freeman, and whether the twelfhynde are
an exclusive class of magnates, raised above them
during the progressive development of the royal
power; or whether, on the contrary, the twelfhynde
and twýhynde are the original divisions, and the sixhynde
a middle class of ministerials, which sprang
up when ceorls had entered the service of the crown,
and thus became raised above their fellow freemen.
I incline to the latter opinion, partly from the apparent
absence of this sixhynde class in Mercia,
partly from the apposition noticed above, and the
omission of the sixhynde altogether from the passage
in Eádweard’s law, which regulates the payments
for the other two classes. There is no statement
of a royal <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> in Wessex, but from what
has been said of the composition made for Múl, it
may be inferred that it was thirty thousand sceattas
or 120 pounds, like that of Mercia. The total inconsistency
of these several values will be apparent
if we arrange them tabularly:</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this variety, which is totally irrespective of
the real value of the þryms and the shilling, seems
to involve this part of the subject in impenetrable
darkness. All that we can permit ourselves to
guess is, that circumstances had in process of time
altered the original relations between the classes,
but in different ratios in the different kingdoms.
This however is not all the difficulty: we have
to contend with the complication arising from the
fact, that the scilling, the currency in which all the
southern calculations are nominally made, really
differed in value in the several states: and thus
when we attempt to compare one freeman with
another, we find their respective prices to be in
Mercia 833⅓ sceats, in Kent 3600.</p>

<p class='c001'>However the details were arranged, the principle
itself is clear enough, and we must now be content
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>to remain in ignorance of the means adopted to reconcile
conflicting interests measured by a standard
so imperfect.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> or price of the whole man was
not all that the law professed to regulate. When
once the principle had been admitted, that this
might be fixed at a certain sum, it was an easy
corollary not only that the sum in question should
limit the amount of responsibility to the State<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c008'><sup>[522]</sup></a> but
that a tariff for all injuries should be settled. In
the laws of Æðelberht and Ælfred we find very
detailed assessments of the damage which could be
done to a man by injuries, either of his person, his
property, or his honour: many of these are amusing
and strange enough, and highly indicative
of the rude state of society for which they were
adapted. But it seems unnecessary to pursue the
details they deal with: they may serve to turn a
period about Teutonic barbarism, or to point a
moral about human fallibility; but the circumstances
under which they were rational and convenient
arrangements have passed away, and they
are now of little interest as historical records, and
of none with a view to future utility.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> FOLCLAND. BÓCLAND. LǼNLAND.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a wise insight into the accidents of increasing
population which limited the amount of the
original éðel, or allodial estate. By leaving, as it
were, a large fund to be drawn upon, as occasion
might serve, the principle, that every freeman must
be settled on land, was maintained, without condemning
society to a stationary condition, as to
numbers. The land thus left, of which the usufruct,
under certain conditions, was enjoyed by the
freemen, was called Folcland, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra publica, ager
publicus</i></span>. It was distinguished from the éðel by
not becoming absolute property in the hands of
individuals, consequently by not being hereditary.
The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium utile</i></span> might be granted; the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium
directum</i></span> remained in the state, which was a
perpetual feoffee for certain trusts and uses. And
hence folcland was subject to rents of divers kinds,
and reversion. The folcland could also be applied
to reward great public services, in which case
estates of alod, or éðel, were carved out of it, and
presented to him whom the community desired to
honour<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c008'><sup>[523]</sup></a>. The service which Wulf and Eofer did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>by slaying Ongenðeów was rewarded with a grant
of land and rings<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c008'><sup>[524]</sup></a>. The clearest view of the nature
and object of folcland is given us by Beda, who
complains that it is diverted from its proper purpose,—which
is, to be granted as a support to those
whose arms would defend the country,—under pretence
of erecting monasteries, which are a disgrace
to their profession. The following are his extremely
important words:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And since there are both very numerous and
very extensive tracts, which, to adopt the common
saying, are of use neither to God nor man,—seeing
indeed that in them there is neither maintained
a regular life according to God’s law, nor
are they possessed by the soldiers or comites of
secular persons, who might defend our race from
the barbarians,—if any one, to meet the want of
our time, should establish an episcopal see in
those places, he will be proved not to incur the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>guilt of prevarication, but rather to perform an act
of virtue<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c008'><sup>[525]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And again, he continues:</p>

<p class='c001'>“By which example it behoves also your Holiness,
in conjunction with our religious king, to
abrogate the irreligious deeds and writings of our
predecessors, and to provide for the general advantage
of our kingdom, either in reference to
God, or to the world: lest in our days, either
through the cessation of religion, the love and fear
of an inspector at home should be abandoned; or,
on the other hand, the supply of our secular militia
decreasing, we should not have those who might
defend our boundaries from the incursions of barbarians.
For, what is disgraceful to say, persons
who have not the least claim to the monastic character,
as you yourself best know, have got so many
of these spots into their power, under the name of
monasteries, that there is really now no place at
all where the sons of nobles or veteran soldiers can
receive a grant<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c008'><sup>[526]</sup></a>. And thus, idle and unmarried,
being grown up to manhood, they live on in no profession
of chastity; and on this account, they either
cross the sea and desert the country which they
ought to serve with their arms; or, what is even
more criminal and shameless, having no profession
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of chastity, they give themselves up to luxury and
fornication, and abstain not even from the virgins
consecrated to God<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c008'><sup>[527]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The evils of a course which, by preventing the
possibility of marriage, tends to the general neglect
of morality, are as obvious in this state of society,
as in those where the indefinite partition of estates
reduces all the members of the higher classes to a
state of poverty,—a fact perfectly familiar in countries
where the resources of trade are not permitted
to mitigate the mischief of subdivision.</p>

<p class='c001'>The folcland then in England was the national
stock. It is probable that the same thing occurred
in other Teutonic states, and that the folcland there
also formed a reserve from which endowments of
individuals, homeborn or foreign, and of religious
houses, were made. Thus, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Princeps de eius recuperatione
simul et postulatione multum gavisus,
et suum ad hoc consensum et parentum adeptus est
favorem; deditque illi in eisdem partibus, multas
possessiones <em>de publico</em>, quatinus viciniori potentia
soceris acceptior factus, non minori apud illos, quam
in genitali solo praecelleret dignitate</span><a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c008'><sup>[528]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We cannot now tell the exact terms upon which
the usufruct of the folcland was permitted to individual
holders. Much of it was probably distributed
in severalty, to be enjoyed by the grantee
during his life, and then to revert to the donor the
State. As the holders of such lands were most probably
not included in the Marks, like the owners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>of allodial property, they may have formed the proper
basis of the original <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gyldscipas</span>, and have been
more immediately subject to the jurisdiction of the
scírgemót; for it is impossible to believe that their
condition was one of such perfect freedom as that
of the original allodial owners.</p>

<p class='c001'>A portion also of the folcland may long have subsisted
as common land, subject to the general rights
of all<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c008'><sup>[529]</sup></a>. In this respect it must have resembled the
public land of the Romans. Only that, the true
Roman burghers or Patricians, being comparatively
few, while the other claimants were many, and self-defence
therefore commanded the utmost caution
in admitting them to isotely,—the struggles between
the Patrician and Plebeian orders necessarily
assumed in Rome a character of exasperation and
hostility which was wanting in England. But it
does not appear that in this country, the tribes of
the Gewissas could have made any claim to the
folcland of the Mercians, or that those of the
Welsh would have found favour with any Saxon
community.</p>

<p class='c001'>In whatever form the usufruct may have been
granted, it was accompanied by various settled
burthens. In the first place were the inevitable
charges from which no land was ever relieved;
namely military service, alluded to by Beda, and
no doubt in early times performed in person: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>repair of roads, bridges and fortifications. But
besides these, there were dues payable to the king,
and the geréfa; watch and ward on various occasions;
aid in the royal hunting; convoy of messengers
going and coming on the public service, from
one royal vill to another; harbouring of the king,
his messengers and huntsmen; lastly provision for
his hawks, hounds and horses. In addition to these,
there were heavy payments in kind, which were to
be delivered at the royal vills, to each of which,
various districts were apparently made appurtenant,
for this purpose; and on which stores, so duly delivered,
the king and his household in some degree
depended for subsistence. These were comprised
under the name <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Cyninges-feorm</span>, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Firma regis</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is from the occasional exemptions granted by
the authority of the king and his witan, that we
learn what burthens the folcland was subject to: it
may therefore be advantageous to cite a few examples,
which will make the details clear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between 791 and 796, eighty hides of land at
Westbury and Hanbury were relieved by Offa from
the dues to kings, dukes and their subordinates;
except these payments, that is to say, the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafol</i></span> at
Westbury (sixty hides), two tuns full of bright
ale, and a comb full of smooth ale, and a comb full
of Welsh ale, and seven oxen, and six wethers, and
forty cheeses, and six <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">langðero</span> (?), and thirty ambers
of rough corn, and four ambers of meal, to the
royal vill<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c008'><sup>[530]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>In 863, an estate at Marsham was to pay by the
year, twenty staters of cheese, forty lambs, forty
fleeces, and two days’ <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pastus</i></span><a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c008'><sup>[531]</sup></a> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">feorm</span>, which last
might be commuted for thirty silver shillings (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>argentea</i></span>)<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c008'><sup>[532]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 877, Bishop Tunberht, with the consent of his
chapter, appropriated lands at Nursling to the use
of the refectory. His charter says he grants it,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberam ab omnibus terrenis difficultatibus omnium
gravitudinum, sive a pastu regis, principis,
exactoris; et ab omni aedificiorum opere, tributo,
a paraveredis, a taxationibus quod dicimus wíterǽdene;
omnium rerum saecularium perpetualiter
libera sit, excepta expeditione et pontis aedificatione</span><a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c008'><sup>[533]</sup></a>.”
As he could not do this by his own authority,
he probably only means to record that they
had been so freed by the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Witena-gemót</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 883, twenty years later, a monastery is freed
from all which the monks were still bound to pay
to the king’s hand, as cyningfeorm, both in bright
ale, beer, honey, oxen, swine and sheep, in short

<p class='c001'>The dues from the monastery at Taunton were
as follows: a feorm of one night for the king, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>eight dogs and one dog-keeper; and nine nights’

<p class='c001'>The payments reserved upon twenty hides at
Titchbourn, which Eádweard in 901-909 granted

probably the old royal gafol: they were now transferred
to the church as <em>double-commons</em> for founder’s
day. They amounted to, twelve sexters of
beer, twelve of sweetened Welsh ale, twenty ambers
of bright ale, two hundred large and one hundred
small loaves, two oxen fresh or salted, six wethers,
four swine, four flitches, and twenty cheeses; but if

<p class='c001'>Many of the instances we meet with, both in
England and upon the Continent, are those of
churches or monasteries: this is natural, inasmuch
as the clergy were most likely to obtain and record
these exemptions. But how, it may be asked, did
it happen that such exemptions were necessary?
It seems to me that, when Christianity was introduced,
and folcland was granted for the erection or
the endowment of a church, the burthens were not
always discharged; and that the piety of later times
was occasionally appealed to, to remedy the carelessness
or alter the policy of early founders.</p>

<p class='c001'>Folcland may be considered the original and general
name of all estates save the hlot, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sors</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">alód</span>
of the first markmen: the whole country was divided
into Folclands, containing one or more hides,
subject to folcriht or the public law,—and hence
having no privilege or immunity of any sort; in
many instances where Beda uses <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra unius tributarii</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra familiae unius</i></span>, and similar expressions,
he can only mean to denote separate and distinct
portions of folcland, and the words of Ælfred’s
translation imply the same thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The power of disposal over this land lay in the
nation itself, or the state; that is, in the king and
his witan; but in what way, or by what ceremonies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>it was conferred, we no longer know. Still there
is great probability that it was done by some of
those well-known symbols, which survived both at
home and abroad in the familiar forms of livery of
seisin,—by the straw, the rod or yard, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cespes
viridis</i></span> and the like<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c008'><sup>[544]</sup></a>. We may however distinctly
assert that it was not given by book or charter, inasmuch
as this form was reserved to pass estates
under very different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very fact that folcland was not the object of
a charter causes our information respecting it to be
meagre: it is merely incidentally and fortuitously
that it is mentioned in those documents from which
we derive so much valuable insight into the antiquities
of Saxon England. But even from them we
may infer that it was not hereditary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the end of the ninth century, Ælfred,
who appears to have been ealdorman or duke of
Surrey, devised his lands by will. He left almost
all his property to his daughter; and to his son
Æðelwald (perhaps an illegitimate child,) he gave
only three hides of hereditary land, bócland, expressing
however his hope that the king would
permit his son to hold the folcland he himself had
held. But as this was uncertain, in order to meet
the case of a disappointment, he directed that if
the king refused this, his daughter should choose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>which she would give her brother, of two hereditary
estates which he had devised to her<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c008'><sup>[545]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, shortly before the Conquest, we find Abbot
Wulfwold thus informing Gisa bishop of Wells,
Ægelnoð the abbot, Tofig the sheriff, and all the
thanes in Somerset<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c008'><sup>[546]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eádweard the king, my lord, gave me the land
at Corfestige which my father held, and the four
farms at Æscwíc, and the fields of meadow-land
thereunto belonging, and in wood and field so much
that I had pasture for my cattle and the cattle of
my men; and all as free in every respect as the
king’s own <a id='corr300.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='demesme'>demesne</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_300.13'><ins class='correction' title='demesme'>demesne</ins></a></span>, to give or sell, during my day
or after my day, to whomsoever it best pleases me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In both these cases it is clear that the land was
holden as a benefice; that the tenant had only a
life interest, which Wulfwold however succeeded in
converting into a <em>fee</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the State were the grantors, so also there appears
to have been no restriction as to the persons of
the grantees. Of course this does not include serfs,
or others below the degree of freemen; although an
emancipated serf may sometimes have been provided
with an estate of folcland, by general donation.
But there is no reason to doubt that every
other class might obtain grants of folcland. Those
of a duke and of various bishops have been mentioned;
Wulfwold’s father was probably, at least a
thane. But even the king himself could and did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>hold land of this description. The boundary of an
estate is said to run to the king’s folcland; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab
occidente Cyninges folcland quod habet Wighelm
et Wulfláf<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c008'><sup>[547]</sup></a>.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>At a very early period however it became a practice
to carve hereditary estates out of the folcland,
which thus became the private property of the
individual, and could by him be given, sold, or
devised at his pleasure; by which the reversion to
the state was defeated, and the common stock insofar
diminished. It was also usual to release such
land from all the dues which had previously been
rendered from it, and to make it absolutely free<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c008'><sup>[548]</sup></a>,
with the exception of the three services which
were inevitably incident to all landed possession,
and which are consequently known by the names
of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Communis labor</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Generalis incommoditas</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Onus
inevitabile</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Trinoda necessitas</i></span>, and similar expressions.
These estates were always granted by book
or charter, and hence bore the name of bócland:
and it is questionable whether the two descriptions
did not, at a very early period, comprise all the
land in England, as the families of the first allodial
possessors died out, and their possessions either
reverted to the state, or became alienated under
circumstances which included them in the category
of bócland.</p>

<p class='c001'>We learn that the pretext upon which these conversions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of folcland into bócland were made at first,
was the erection and endowment of a religious house
upon the land, by the grantee; and we also learn
that sometimes the conversion was made, the thane
presented with the estate, but the church or monastery
not constructed. Soon after the introduction
of Christianity into Northumberland, it appears
indeed to have been customary to grant much
greater privileges and immunities to church-lands
than were found advisable at a later period, or than
seem to have been permitted in the provinces south
of the Humber. It stands to reason that there
could be no reversion in lands granted to a corporation:
hence folcland which had been presented to
a church assumed what may be called a hereditary
character<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c008'><sup>[549]</sup></a>, and could only lapse by total destruction
of the particular body,—a circumstance which
could obviously never be contemplated, but which
did actually occur during the civil wars, internal
dissensions and foreign invasions, which gradually
changed the face of the whole country<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c008'><sup>[550]</sup></a>. But the
lands which the Northumbrian princes devoted to
pious purposes, were most likely relieved from all
burthens whatsoever: we have conclusive evidence
that even military service was excused in that district
before the time of Beda. In all probability,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>it was not suspected how much the defences of
the country might become impaired by grants of
the kind. The passages already cited from Beda’s
epistle to Ecgberht may be adduced in corroboration
of these assertions, but we have more direct
evidence in his history<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c008'><sup>[551]</sup></a>. Oswiú on his conversion
placed his daughter Eánflǽd in the convent
presided over by Hild, and with her he gave
twelve estates, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessiunculae terrarum,</span>” most
likely folcland, each estate comprising ten hides;
in which, Beda continues, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ablato studio militiae
terrestris, ad exercendam militiam coelestem locus
facultasque suppeteret,</span>”—or as the Saxon translator
expresses it, “Those twelve <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bóclands</span> he freed
from earthly warfare and earthly service, to be employed
in heavenly warfare.” It is very clear that
the duties of military service were removed in this
case, and that religious warfare was to be the destination
of those that held the lands. Similarly
when Benedict Biscop decided upon devoting himself
to a monastic life, he surrendered his lands to
the king<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c008'><sup>[552]</sup></a>. These must obviously have been folcland,
the retaining of which he considered impossible,
under the circumstances; and which, not
being his own, he could not take with him into a
monastery: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">despexit militiam cum corruptibili
donativo terrestrem, ut vero regi militaret;</span>” and
these words of Beda clearly show how we are
to understand what he says of Oswiú's grant to
Whitby.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>The gaining of a hereditary character for lands,
and especially the relief from heavy dues, were advantages
which might speedily arouse the avarice
and stimulate the invention even of barbarians.
Accordingly those who could gain access to the ear
of the king and his witan, bought, or begged or extorted
grants of privileged land, which they either
converted entirely into private estates, or upon
which they erected monasteries, nominally such:
and over these, which they filled with irregular and
often profligate monks, they assumed the jurisdiction
of abbots; with such little advantage to the
service of religion, that we have seen Beda describe
them as a public scandal, and recommend even the
desperate remedy of cancelling, by royal and episcopal
authority, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>privilegia</i></span> or charters on which
their immunities reposed.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the growing prevalence of this fraud we probably
owe it that, at least in Wessex, the custom
arose of confiscating land on which the conditions
of the grant had not been fulfilled. Thus Ini called
in the lands which Cissa had granted to Hean the
abbot and Cille the abbess, his sister, because no
religious buildings had been erected thereon: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed
Ini rex eandem terram, postea dum regno potiretur,
<em>diripiens ac reipublicae restituit</em>, nondum constructo
monasterio in ea, nec ullo admodum oratorio
erecto<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c008'><sup>[553]</sup></a>;</span>” that is, as I understand it, folcland
they had been, and folcland they again became. But
even this did not meet all the exigencies of the case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>and it therefore probably became necessary, even
in bócland granted to the church, to reserve the
military and other services, which the clergy could
cause to be performed by their own dependent cultivators
or tenants, even if they were not compelled
to serve themselves,—a point which is by no means
clear<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c008'><sup>[554]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A majority of the documents contained in the
Codex Diplomaticus Ævi Saxonici are conversions
of folcland into bócland, or confirmations of such
conversions. They almost universally contain a
clause declaring or <em>proclaiming</em>—such is the technical
word for this important public act, by which
prince and king, ealdorman and sheriff, were at
once made strangers to the land—the estate free
from every burthen save the inevitable three; a
clause giving the fullest hereditary possession, and
the power to dispose of it by will at the testator’s
pleasure; and finally a clause stating that this is
done by the authority of the king, with the advice,
consent and license of his Witan or counsellors.
They remain therefore to the last important public
acts, and are, I believe universally, to be considered
acts of the assembled Witena-gemót or great council
of the nation<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c008'><sup>[555]</sup></a>. And as by their authority folcland
could be converted into bócland, so it appears
could the reverse take place; and a change in the
nature of two estates is recorded<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c008'><sup>[556]</sup></a>, where the king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>gave five ploughlands of folcland for five of bócland,
and then made the folcland bócland, the bócland
folcland.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this general spoliation it is to be supposed that
the kings would not omit to share: accordingly we
find them causing estates to be booked to them by
their witan; which estates, when thus become their
private and heritable property, they devise and deal
with at their pleasure: and indeed, as the king’s
consent was necessary to all such conversions, he
was much better able to obtain that of his witan in
his own case, than bishops, thanes or others were
in their cases: these generally found themselves
compelled to pay handsomely for the favour they
required. With respect to ecclesiastical lands, we
frequently find a loss of very large estates submitted
to, in order to secure freedom to what remained.
There are also a few instances in which
lands having descended, encumbered with payments,
the owners engage some powerful noble or
ecclesiastic to obtain their freedom,—that is, to persuade
the witan into abolishing the charges. The
gratuity offered to the member whose influence was
to carry these ancient private acts of parliament, is
often very considerable. Towards the closing period
of the Anglosaxon polity, I should imagine
that nearly every acre of land in England had become
bócland; and that as, in consequence of this,
there was no more room for the expansion of a free
population, the condition of the freemen became depressed,
while the estates of the lords increased in
number and extent. In this way the ceorlas or free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>cultivators gradually vanished, yielding to the ever
growing force of the noble class, accepting a dependent
position upon their bócland, and standing
to right in their courts, instead of their own old
county gemótas; while the lords themselves ran
riot, dealt with their once free neighbours at their
own discretion, and filled the land with civil dissensions
which not even the terrors of a foreign invasion
could still. Nothing can be more clear than
that the universal breaking up of society in the time
of Æðelred had its source in the ruin of the old
free organization of the country. The successes of
Swegen and Cnut, and even of William the Norman,
had much deeper causes than the mere gain or loss
of one or more battles. A nation never falls till
“the citadel of its moral being” has been betrayed
and become untenable. Northern invasions will
not account for the state of brigandage which
Æðelred and his Witan deplore in so many of their
laws. The ruin of the free cultivators and the
overgrowth of the lords are much more likely
causes. At the same time it is even conceivable
that, but for the invasions of the ninth and tenth
centuries, the result which I have described might
have come upon us more suddenly. The sword
and the torch, plague, pestilence and famine are
very effectual checks to the growth of population,
and sufficient for a long time to adjust the balance
between the land and those it has to feed.</p>

<p class='c001'>An estate of bócland might be subject to conditions.
It was perhaps not always easy to obtain
from the Witan all that avarice desired: accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>we sometimes find limitations in grants, to a certain
number of lives with remainders and reversions.
And it was both law and custom not only that the
first acquirer might impose what conditions he
pleased upon the descent of the estate, but that to
all time his expressed will in that respect should
bind those who derived their title from him<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c008'><sup>[557]</sup></a>. Ælfred
requires his Witan, who are the guarantees
and administrators of his will, to see that he has
not violated the disposition of his ancestors by
leaving lands to women which had been entailed
on the male line, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span><a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c008'><sup>[558]</sup></a>; and we have
cases of grants solemnly avoided for like want of
conformity. More questionable in point of principle
is the right attempted to be set up by some
of these purchasers, to bar escheat and forfeiture
of the land upon felony of their heirs or devisees.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be presumed that a tenant of folcland
was permitted to let the same,—upon condition no
doubt that he conveyed no estate superior to his
own. The holders must have been allowed to place
poor settlers upon their estates, whose rents and
services, in labour and kind, would be important
to their own subsistence. Of course in bócland no
limitation could be thought of; it was the absolute,
inheritable property of the purchaser, and he could
in general dispose of it as freely as if it were alod
itself. But there seems no reason to doubt that
much the same course was adopted in both descriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>of estate; the folcland being held beyond question
for term of life, at every period of which our
history takes cognizance, whatever may have been
the case at first. A portion called the inland, or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dominium</i></span>,
<em>demesne</em>, was reserved for the lord’s homestead,
house and farms, and the dwellings of his serfs,
esnes, læts, and other unfree and poor dependents.
This was cultivated for him by their industry, and
he repaid their services by protection, food, clothing,
and small perquisites, all of which now pass
under the general name of wages<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c008'><sup>[559]</sup></a>. On the upland
and in the forests, sometimes his own, sometimes
subject only to his rights of common, they tended
his sheep, oxen and steeds at the fold, or his swine
in the mast, lying out during the appointed season
of the year<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c008'><sup>[560]</sup></a>, or within the circuit of his own inclosures
they exercised such simple manufactures as
the necessities of the household required. The spinner
and weaver, the glove- or shoemaker, the smith
and carpenter, were all parts of the family. The
butter and cheese, bread and bacon, were made at
home; the beer was brewed and the honey collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>by the household. The remainder of the land the
owner leased on various conditions to men who
had no land; demanding in return for that commodity,
indispensable in a country which has not
yet learnt to manufacture, rents paid in kind, in
labour, and even in money. This labour-rent, yet
called <em>robot</em> in Slavonic countries, as well as the
other dues, naturally varied in various districts,
partly with the importance of land<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c008'><sup>[561]</sup></a>, to the cultivator,
and the value of its produce to the owner.
And at last political motives may have had some
weight, when the number and condition of a man’s
dependents might affect his own influence and position
in the state: but in general we shall be justified
in saying that land was very valuable, and the
conditions on which it was to be obtained harsh and
onerous<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c008'><sup>[562]</sup></a>. Such land, whether in large or in small
portions, whether leased on long or short terms,
large or small rents, was called by the common
name of Lǽn, or loan<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c008'><sup>[563]</sup></a>. It was considered to be
lent; and where the lǽn was on folcland, it is obvious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>that no certain time could be assigned, and
that the after-tenant could have only a tenancy at
will. In any case it was reasonable that misconduct
in the holder, which would have entailed upon
him the forfeiture of his own real property, should
not be permitted to interfere with the rights of the
reversioner: lǽnland therefore could not be taken
from the owner, for the crime of the tenant. In the
year 900 a certain Helmstán was guilty of theft, and
the sheriff seized all his chattels to the king: and
Ordláf entered upon the land, “because it was his
lǽn that Helmstán sat on: that he could not forfeit<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c008'><sup>[564]</sup></a>.”
A similar principle prevailed in grants for
lives, especially where ecclesiastical corporations
were the grantors and reversioners; and which,
though to a certain extent they conveyed estates
of bócland, gave, strictly speaking, lǽn or beneficiary
tenures<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c008'><sup>[565]</sup></a>. But as the clergy were not always
quite sure of meeting with fair treatment, we find
them not unfrequently introducing into their instruments
a provision that no forfeiture shall be valid
against their rights; this, from the great strictness
with which the provisions of a book or charter were
always construed, and in general from the fear of
violating what had been confirmed by the signature
of the cross and the threat of eternal punishment,
may have had some effect. In such cases it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>be presumed that the guilt of the grantee entirely
cancelled the grant; the remaining lives, if any, losing
the advantage which they derived through the
grantee; forfeiture really taking effect, but for the
benefit of the grantor, not the civil power<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c008'><sup>[566]</sup></a>. The
tenant of lǽnland, who by his services acquired
the good will of the lord, might hope to have his
tenure improved, if not into an absolute possession
of bócland, yet into one for his own or more lives.
In a translation of St. Augustine of Hippo’s Soliloquia,
attributed like so many other things to Ælfred
of Wessex, there occurs this passage<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c008'><sup>[567]</sup></a>:</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it pleaseth every man, when he hath built
himself some cottage upon his lord’s lǽn, with his
assistance, for a while to take up his rest thereon,
and hunt, and fowl and fish, and in divers ways
provide for himself upon the lǽn, both by sea and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>land, until the time when by his lord’s compassion
he can earn a bócland and eternal inheritance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And instances occur in more formal documents.
In 977, Oswald, Archbishop of York and Bishop
of Worcester, made a grant of three hides at Teddington,
for three lives, to Eádríc his thane, with reversion
to Worcester: “Now there are three hides
of this land which Archbishop Oswald booketh to
Eádríc his thane, both near town and from town,
even as he before held them as lǽnland<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c008'><sup>[568]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In another grant of the same prelate, between
972-992, made to his <em>client</em> Ælfsige, of a dwelling
in Worcester city, for three lives, he adds, “Also
we write [or book] to him the croft appurtenant to
that tenement, which lies to the east of Wulfsige’s
croft; that he may hold it in as large measure, for
bócland, as he before held it for lǽnland<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c008'><sup>[569]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 977, the same convent at Worcester booked
three hides for three lives to the monk Wynsige,
even as his father had held them<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c008'><sup>[570]</sup></a>; and in 978-992,
they gave to Goding the priest, also for three lives,
the tenement which he himself had without the city
gate<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c008'><sup>[571]</sup></a>. In both these cases lǽn appears to have
been converted into estate for successive lives.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where there was lǽn, there could properly be no
book, because the possession of the charter itself
was <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span> evidence (indeed nearly conclusive
evidence) in favour of the holder. Hence, where
from any circumstance the books were withheld,
the tenant had only a lǽn: this was the case with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Helmstán’s estates mentioned above: he had deposited
his charters with Ordláf as a security on an
occasion when this duke helped him to make oath
to some property. On Helmstán’s felony, Ordláf
seized the land to himself, and the document from
which we learn this is obviously his appeal to Ælfred’s
son and successor, against an attempt to disturb
Helmstán’s original title, under a judgment
given by Ælfred. Nor was it unusual for books to
be thus retained as securities, by which the tenant
having only a lǽn could be evicted, if not at pleasure,
at least by legal process<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c008'><sup>[572]</sup></a>. And the same remarks
apply to a very common mode of disposing
of estates, where the clergy were grantees. Either
to avoid litigation with justly exasperated heirs,
or to escape from the commands of various synods,
the clergy used to take deeds of gift from living
tenants, impounding the books of course, and leaving
the life-interest only to the owner. Such an
estate in technical Latin was named <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>praestaria</i></span>; but
it was obviously a lǽn, and was generally charged
with recognitory payments<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c008'><sup>[573]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may not be uninteresting, before I close this
chapter, to give some examples of the gafol or rent
paid upon lands whether held for lives, or as, more
strictly, lǽnland. They are extremely valuable from
the insight they give into the details of social life,
and the daily habits of our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Twenty hides of land at Sempringham were
leased by Peterborough to Wulfred for two lives,
on condition of his getting its freedom, and that
of Sleaford (both in Lincolnshire): upon this estate
the following yearly rent was reserved. First, to
the monastery: two tons of bright ale, two oxen,
fit for slaughter, two <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mittan</i></span> or measures of Welsh
ale, and six hundred loaves. Secondly to the abbot’s
private estate: one horse, thirty shillings of
silver or half a pound, one night’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pastus</i></span>, fifteen
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mittan</i></span> of bright and five of Welsh ale, fifteen <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sesters</i></span>
of mild ale<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c008'><sup>[574]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little earlier, Oswulf, a duke in Kent, devised
lands to Christchurch Canterbury, which he charged
with annual doles to the poor upon his anniversary.
Forty hides at Stanhampstead were to find
one hundred and twenty loaves of wheat, thirty
loaves of fine wheat<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c008'><sup>[575]</sup></a>, one fat ox and four sheep,
two flitches of bacon, five geese, ten hens, and ten
pounds of cheese. If it fell on a fast-day, however,
there was to be (instead of the meat) a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wey</i></span> of
cheese, and fish, butter, eggs <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>. Moreover,
thirty ambers of good Welsh ale, on the footing of
fifteen <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mittan</i></span>, and one <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mitta</i></span> of honey (perhaps to
make into a drink) or two of wine. From his land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>at Burnan were to issue one thousand loaves, and
one thousand raised loaves or cakes; and the monks
themselves were to find one hundred and twenty
more of the latter<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c008'><sup>[576]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Werhard gave two juga or geoc of land to Canterbury.
The rent of one at Lambahám was forty
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pensas</i></span> (weys) of cheese, or an equivalent in lambs
and wool; the other, at Northwood, rendered one
hundred and twenty measures, which the English
call ambers, of salt<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c008'><sup>[577]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lufe, in 832, charged the inheritors and assigns
of her land at Mundlinghám, with the following
yearly payment to Canterbury, for ever; that is to
say: Sixty ambers of malt, one hundred and fifty
loaves, fifty white loaves, one hundred and twenty
alms-loaves, one ox, one hog and four wethers,
two weys of bacon and cheese, one mitta of honey,
ten geese and twenty hens<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c008'><sup>[578]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 835, Abba, a reeve in Kent, charged his heirs
with a yearly payment to Folkstone, of fifty ambers
of malt, six ambers of groats (gruta?), three weys
of bacon and cheese, four hundred loaves, one
ox, and six sheep, besides an allowance or stipend
in money to the priests<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c008'><sup>[579]</sup></a>. And Heregyð, his wife,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>farther burthened her land at Challock with payments
to Canterbury, amounting to: thirty ambers
of ale, three hundred loaves, fifty of them white,
one wey of bacon and cheese, one old ox, four
wethers, and one hog, or six wethers, six geese
and ten hens, one sester of honey, one of butter,
and one of salt; and if her anniversary should fall
in winter, she added thirty wax-lights<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c008'><sup>[580]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 902, Bishop Denewulf leased fifteen hides of
church-land at Eblesburn to his relative Beornwulf
for forty-five shillings a year, with liberty to Beornwulf’s
children to continue the lease. One shilling
(sixty of which went to the pound) is so very small
a rent for ten acres, that we must either suppose
the land to have been unusually bad, or Beornwulf’s
connection with the bishop much in his favour<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c008'><sup>[581]</sup></a>.
He was also to aid in cyricbót, and pay the cyric-sceat.
About the same time Denewulf leased forty
hides at Alresford to one Ælfred, at the old rent of
three pounds per annum, or four shillings and a half
per hide. He was however also to pay <em>church-shot</em>,
the amount of which is not stated, and to do <em>church-shot-work</em>,
and find men to the bishop’s reaping and
hunting<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c008'><sup>[582]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between 901-909, king Eádweard booked twenty
hides of land to Bishop Denewulf. The payments
reserved have been already mentioned: instead of
going to the king as gafol or rent, they were to
be expended in an anniversary feast on founder’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>day. I have already stated that this may be the
old charge on folcland: it was a grant from the
monks to the bishop, probably negotiated by Eádweard.
All parties were satisfied: the monks probably
got from the land as much as they could expect
from any other tenant, or what, if folcland,
they would themselves have had to pay; the bishop
got the land into his own hands, to dispose of at his
pleasure, and the king was rewarded for intervention
with all the benefits to be derived on his anniversary
from the prayers of the grateful fathers at
Winchester.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the close of the ninth century, Werfrið bishop
of Worcester claimed land under the following circumstances.
Milred a previous bishop had granted
an estate in Sopbury, on condition that it was to
be always held by a clergyman, and never by a
layman, and that if no clergyman could be found
in the grantee’s family, it should revert to the see.
By degrees the family of the grantee established
themselves in the possession, but without performing
the condition. At length Werfrið impleaded
their chief Eádnóð, who admitted the wrong and
promised to find a clergyman. The family however
all refused to enter into holy orders. Eádnóð then
obtained the intercession of Æðelred duke of Mercia,
the lady Æðelflǽd, and Æðelnóð duke of
Somerset; and by their persuasion, Werfrið (in defiance
of his predecessor’s charter) sold the land to
Eádnóð for forty mancuses, reserving a yearly rent
of fifteen shillings, and a vestment (or perhaps some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>kind of hanging) to be delivered at the episcopal
manor of Tetbury<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c008'><sup>[583]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ealdwulf bishop of Worcester leased forty acres
of land and a fishery for three lives to Leofenað,
on condition that they delivered yearly fifteen salmon,
and those good ones too, during the bishop’s
residence in Worcester, on Ashwednesday<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c008'><sup>[584]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Eádríc <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gafeled</i></span> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">gafelian</span>), i. e. paid yearly rent or
gafol for two hides with half a pound, or thirty shillings,
and a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gare</i></span>, a word I do not understand<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c008'><sup>[585]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 835, the Abbess Cyneware gave land to Hunberht,
a duke, on condition that he paid a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gablum</i></span>,
gafol or rent of three hundred shillings in lead
yearly to Christchurch Canterbury<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c008'><sup>[586]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ceorlas or dependent freemen who were settled
upon the land of Hurstbourn in the days of
Ælfred, had the following rents to pay; many of
these are labour rents, many arise out of the land
itself, viz. are part of the produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>From each hide, at the autumnal equinox, forty
pence. Further they were to pay, six church-mittan
of ale, and three sesters or horseloads of white
wheat. Out of their own time they were to plough
three acres, and sow them with their own seed, to
house the produce, to pay three pounds of gafol-barley,
to mow half an acre of gafolmead and
stack the hay, to split four foðer orloads of gafolwood
and stack it, to make sixteen rods of gafol-hedging<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c008'><sup>[587]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>At Easter they were further to pay two
ewes and lambs, two young sheep being held equivalent
to one old one: these they were to wash and
shear out of their own time. Lastly, every week they
were to do any work which might be required of
them, except during the three weeks, at Christmas,
Easter and the Gangdays<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c008'><sup>[588]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following customs and payments are recorded
in various manors: some of the words I
cannot translate. “In Dyddanham there are thirty
hides; nine of these are inland (demesne), twenty-one
are let<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c008'><sup>[589]</sup></a>. In Stræt are twelve hides, twenty-seven
yards of gafolland; and on the Severn there
are thirty cytweras<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c008'><sup>[590]</sup></a>. In Middleton are five hides,
fourteen yards of gafolland, fourteen cytweras on
the Severn, and two hæcweras on the Way. At
Kingston there are five hides, thirteen yards of gafolland,
and one hide above the ditch which is now
also gafolland, and that without the ham<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c008'><sup>[591]</sup></a>, is still
in part inland, in part let out on rent to the ship-wealas<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c008'><sup>[592]</sup></a>:
to Kingston belong twenty-one cytweras
on the Severn, and twelve on the Way. In Bishopstún
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>are three hides, and fifteen cytweras on
the Way: in Lancawet are three hides, two hæcweras
on the Way, and two cytweras.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Throughout that land each yardland pays twelve
pence, and four alms-pence: at every weir within the
thirty hides, every second fish belongs to the landlord,
besides every uncommon fish worth having,
sturgeon or porpoise, herring or sea-fish; and no
one may sell any fish for money when the lord is
on the land, until he have had notice of the same.
In Dyddenham the services are very heavy. The
geneát must work, on the land or off the land, as
he is commanded, and ride and carry, lead load
and drive drove, and do many things beside. The
gebúr must do his rights; he must plough half an
acre for week-work, and himself pay the seed in
good condition into the lord’s barn for <em>church-shot</em>,
at all events from his own barn: towards <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>werbold</i></span><a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c008'><sup>[593]</sup></a>,
forty large trees<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c008'><sup>[594]</sup></a> or one load of rods; or eight <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>geocu</i></span>
build<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c008'><sup>[595]</sup></a>, three <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ebban</i></span> close: of field enclosure fifteen
rods, or let him ditch fifteen; and let him ditch one
rod of burg-enclosure; reap an acre and a half, mow
half an acre; work at other works ever according
to their nature. Let him pay sixpence after Easter,
half a sester of honey at Lammas, six sesters of
malt at Martinmas, one clew of good net yarn. In
the same land it is customary that he who hath
seven swine shall give three, and so forth always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the tenth, and nevertheless pay for common of masting,
if mast there be<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c008'><sup>[596]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Unquestionably these are heavy dues, and much
aggravated by the circumstances of the estate or
yardland being but small, the tenant born free, and
some of the services uncertain. I shall conclude this
chapter with a few lines translated from that most
valuable document called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rectitudines singularum
personarum</span><a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c008'><sup>[597]</sup></a>;” as far as the cases of the Geneát,
Cotsetla and Gebúr are concerned<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c008'><sup>[598]</sup></a>. First of the
Geneát or comrade.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Geneát-right is various, according to the
custom of the land. In some places he must pay
landgafol, and a grass-swine yearly; ride and carry,
lead load; work and feed his lord<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c008'><sup>[599]</sup></a>; reap and mow;
hew deer-hedge and hold <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>sæte</i></span><a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c008'><sup>[600]</sup></a>; build and enclose
the burh [or mansion]; make new roads to the
farm; pay church-shot and alms-fee; hold headward
and horseward; go on errand, far or near,
whithersoever he is directed.” This is comparatively
free, and it is only to be regretted that we
do not know what amount of land in general could
be obtained at such a rent. We next come to the
Cotsetlan, whom Ælfred in a passage already cited
states to be on lǽnland, and who are obviously poor
freemen, suffered to settle on the lord’s estate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Cotsettler’s right is according to the custom.
In some places he must work for the lord, every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Monday throughout the year; or three days every
week in harvest; he need pay no landgafol. He
ought to have five acres; more if it be the custom.
And if it be less, it is all too little, for his service
is often called upon. He must pay his hearth-penny
on holy Thursday<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c008'><sup>[601]</sup></a> as it behoves every freeman to
do; and he must acquit<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c008'><sup>[602]</sup></a> his lord’s inland, on summons,
at seaward and at the king’s deer-hedge<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c008'><sup>[603]</sup></a>;
and at such things as are in his competence: and
let him pay his church-shot at Martinmas.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The customs of the Gebúr are very various; in
some places they are heavy, but in some moderate.
In some places it is usual that he shall do two days
week-work, whatever work may be commanded him,
every week throughout the year; and three days
week-work in harvest, and three from Candlemas
to Easter. If he carries<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c008'><sup>[604]</sup></a>, he need not work himself
as long as his horse is out. He must pay at
Michaelmas ten gafol-pence, and at Martinmas
twenty-three sesters of barley, and two hens<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c008'><sup>[605]</sup></a>; at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Easter one young sheep or two pence; and he shall
lie out from Martinmas till Easter at the lord’s
fold<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c008'><sup>[606]</sup></a>; and from the time when the plough is first
put in till Martinmas, he shall plough one acre
every week, and make ready the seed in the lord’s
barn: moreover three acres on request, and two of
grass-ploughing<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c008'><sup>[607]</sup></a>. If he require more grass, let him
earn it on such conditions as he may. For his
rent-ploughing [gafolyrð] he shall plough three
acres and sow them from his own barn; and pay his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>hearth-penny; and two and two shall feed one stag-hound;
and each gebúr shall give six loaves to the
inswán [that is, the swain or swineherd of the demesne]
when he drives his herds to the mast. In
the same land where these conditions prevail, the
gebúr has a right, towards first stocking his land,
to receive two oxen, one cow and six sheep, and
seven acres in his yard of land, ready sown. After
the first year let him do all the customs which belong
to him; and he is to be supplied with tools for
his work, and furniture for his house. When he
dies, let his lord look after what he leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This land-law prevails in some lands; but, as I
have said, in some places it is heavier, in others
lighter; seeing that the customs of all lands are
not alike. In some places the gebúr must pay
honey-gafol, in some meat-gafol, in some ale-gafol.
Let him that holds the shire take heed to
know always what is the old arrangement about
the land, and what the custom of the country!”</p>

<p class='c001'>I can only add the expression of my opinion, that
a careful study of the condition of the peasantry in
the eastern parts of Europe will assist in throwing
much light upon these ancient social arrangements
in this country. Hard as in some respects the condition
of the dependent freeman appears, it must
be borne in mind that the possession of land was
indispensably necessary to life, unless he was to become
an absolute serf. In a country that has little
more manufacture than the simple necessities of
individual households require, no wealth of raw
material and consequently little commerce,—where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>households rejoice in a sort of self-supporting, self-sufficient
autonomy, and the means of internal communication
are imperfect,—land and its produce are
the only wealth; land is the only means whereby
to live. But the Saxon peasant knew his position:
it was a hard one, but he bore it: he worked early
and late, but he worked cheerfully, and amidst all
his toils there is no evidence of his ever having
shot at his landlord from behind a stone wall or a
hedge.</p>

I will not affirm; but at the close of a grant for three lives I find this
memorandum: “Two of the lives have fallen in; then Eádwulf took
it, and granted it to whomsover he would as earningland.” Cod. Dipl.

necessarily on lǽn. The Saxon Chronicle, an. 963, for example uses
that term of the lands which Æðelwold gave to Ely, after purchasing
them of the king. This it is clear he could not have done, had they
been on any person’s lǽn. Were they not perhaps settlements of unlicensed
squatters who had built their cottages on the king’s waste and
deserted lands—the old Mark—in the isle of Ely and Cambridgeshire?

festo Sancti Michaelis x. den. de gablo, et Sancti Martini die xxiii et
sestarium ordei et ii gallinas.</span>” Twenty-three pence at Martinmas is
a considerable sum; however as a sester of corn must even in ordinary
years have been worth quite that sum, it is more reasonable to
follow the Latin than the Saxon.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f606'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r606'>606</a>. The fold was often distant from the homestead, and required careful
watching, especially during the dark winter months. Sheep alone
were not folded, but oxen, cows, and particularly mares: <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hryðrafald,
cúafald, stódfald</span>. This system may be still seen in full force in Hungary;
and we may add that, in the article of horse and cattle stealing,
the Hungarian presents a very marked likeness to the Anglosaxon.
While reading these services, one can hardly get rid of the notion that
one is studying the description of a Hungarian <em>Session</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f607'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r607'>607</a>. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tres acras precum et duas de herbagio:</span> <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">þreo æceras tó béne ⁊
twá tó gærsyðe.</span>” If requested he shall do three acres; but only two
if a meadow is to be broken up? This is always much harder work
than ploughing on old arable. But it is difficult to reconcile this with
the next sentence. The Saxon says, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Gif he máran gærses beþyrfe, <em>earnige</em>
ðæs swá him man þafige:</span>” the Latin, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si plus indigeat herbagio,
<em>arabit</em> proinde sicut ei permittatur.</span>” From the word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>arabit</i></span>, Thorpe
suggests <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>erige</i></span> instead of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>earnige</i></span>. The two readings are however
consistent if we consider the expression gærsyðe as having no connection
with the gærs of the following sentence. I suppose the meaning
to be this: on extraordinary occasions, he might be called upon by the
lord to plough three acres instead of one, or in old meadow-land, two
acres. If now he himself should want more grass-land than he already
possessed, he might make a bargain with the lord, and earn it by this
labour with the plough. He was bound to give one day’s ploughing
every week from the commencement of the ploughing season till the
11th of November: but on pressing emergency, and on request of the
lord, he must give three days (for an acre a day was the just calculation)
or in old meadow two. If his services at the plough were still further
required, he was to make a bargain with his lord; and a common case
is supposed, viz. that he required more grass-land than he had. In this
way all seems intelligible.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'>CHAPTER XII. <br /> HEATHENDOM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An account of the Saxons which should entirely exclude
the peculiarities of their heathendom, would
be deficient in an important degree. Religion and
law are too nearly allied, particularly in early periods,
for us to neglect either, in the consideration
of national institutions. The immediate dependence
of one upon the other we may not be able to show
in satisfactory detail; but we may be assured that
the judicial forms are always in near connexion
with the cult, and that this is especially the case at
times when the judicial and priestly functions are
in the hands of the same class.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Saxons were not without a system of religion,
long before they heard of Christianity, nor
should we be justified in asserting that religion to
have been without moral influence upon the individual
man in his family and social relations. Who
shall dare to say that the high-thoughted barbarian
did not derive comfort in affliction, or support in
difficulty, from the belief that the gods watched
over him,—that he did not bend in gratitude for the
blessings they conferred,—that he was not guided
and directed in the daily business of life by the conviction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of his responsibility to higher powers than
any which he recognized in the world around him?
There has been, and yet is, religion without the
pale of Christianity, however dim and meagre and
unsatisfactory that religion may appear to us whom
the mercy of God has blessed with the true light of
the Gospel. Long before their conversion, all the
Germanic nations had established polities and states
upon an enduring basis,—upon principles which
still form the groundwork and stablest foundation of
the greatest empires of the world,—upon principles
which, far from being abrogated by Christianity,
harmonize with its purest precepts. They who
think states accidental, and would eliminate Providence
from the world, may attempt to reconcile this
truth with their doctrine of <em>barbarism</em>; to us be it
permitted to believe that, in the scheme of an all-wise
and all-pervading mercy, one condition here
below may be the fitting preparation for a higher;
and that even Paganism itself may sometimes be
only as the twilight, through which the first rays of
the morning sun are dimly descried in their progress
to the horizon. Without religion never was
yet state founded, which could endure for ages;
the permanence of our own is the most convincing
proof of the strong foundations on which the massive
fabric, from the first, was reared.</p>

<p class='c001'>The business of this chapter is with the heathendom
of the Saxons; not that portion of it which
yet subsists among us in many of our most cherished
superstitions, some of which long lurked in
the ritual of the unreformed church, and may yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>lurk in the habits and belief of many Protestants;
but that which was the acknowledged creed of the
Saxon, as it was of other Germanic populations;
which once had priests and altars, a ritual and ceremonies,
temples and sacrifices, and all the pomp
and power of a church-establishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proper subjects of mythological inquiry are
the gods and godlike heroes: it is through the latter—for
the most part, forms of the gods themselves—that
a race connects itself with the former.
Among the nations of our race royalty is indeed
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>iure divino</i></span>, for the ruling families are in direct
genealogical descent from divinity, and the possession
of Wóden’s blood was the indispensable condition
of kingship. In our peculiar system, the
vague records of Tuisco, the earth-born god<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c008'><sup>[608]</sup></a>, and
Man, the origin and founders of the race, have
vanished; the mystical cosmogony of Scandinavia
has left no traces among us<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c008'><sup>[609]</sup></a>; but we have nevertheless
a mythological scheme which probably yielded
neither in completeness nor imaginative power to
those of the German or the Norwegian.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the following pages I propose to take into
consideration, first the Gods and Goddesses, properly
so called: secondly, the Monsters or Titanic
powers of our old creed: thirdly, the intermediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>and as it were ministerial beings: and lastly the god-born
and heroic personages of the epopoea.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prudence or the contempt of the earliest
Saxon Christians has left but sparing record of
what Augustine and his brother missionaries overthrew.
Incidental notices indeed are all that remain
in any part of Teutonic Europe; and on the
continent, as well as in England, it is only by the
collation of minute and isolated facts,—often preserved
to us in popular superstitions, legends and
even nursery tales,—that we can render probable
the prevalence of a religious belief identical in its
most characteristic features with that which we
know to have been entertained in Scandinavia. Yet
whatsoever we can thus recover, proves that, in all
main points, the faith of the island Saxons was that
of their continental brethren.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will readily be supposed that the task of demonstrating
this is not easy. The early period
at which Christianity triumphed in England, adds
to the difficulties which naturally beset the subject.
Norway, Sweden and Denmark had entered
into public relations with the rest of Europe, long
before the downfall of their ancient creed: here,
the fall of heathendom and the commencement of
history were contemporaneous: we too had no
Iceland<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c008'><sup>[610]</sup></a> to offer a refuge to those who fled from
the violent course of a conversion, preached sword
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>in hand, and coupled with the loss of political independence;
still the progress of the new faith seems
to have been on the whole easy and continuous
amongst us; and though apostasy was frequent,
history either had no serious struggle to record, or
has wisely and prudently concealed it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In dealing with this subject, we can expect but
little aid from the usual sources of information.
The early chroniclers who lived in times when heathendom
was even less extinct than it now is, and
before it had learnt to hide itself under borrowed
names, would have shrunk with horror from the
mention of what to them, was an execrable impiety:
many of them could have possessed no
knowledge of details which to us would be invaluable,
and no desire to become acquainted with them:
the whole business of their life, on the contrary, was
to destroy the very remembrance that such things
had been, to avoid everything that could recall the
past, or remind their half-converted neophytes of
the creed which they and their forefathers had held.
It is obvious that, under such circumstances, the
greater and more powerful the God, the more dangerous
would he continue to be, the more sedulously
would all mention of him be avoided by
those who had relinquished his service or overthrown
his altars. But though this may be the case with
the principal deities, there are others whose power,
though unacknowledged, is likely to be more permanent.
Long after the formal renunciation of
a public and national paganism, the family and
household gods retain a certain habitual influence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>and continue—often under other names, nay perhaps
engrafted on another creed—to inform the
daily life of a people who are still unconsciously
acted upon by ancient national feelings. A spell or
a popular superstition may yet recall some traces of
the old belief, even as the heathen temple, when
purified with holy water and dedicated in another
name, retained the holiness which had at first been
attached to the site of its foundation.</p>

<p class='c001'>What Paulus Diaconus, Jonas of Bobbio, Jornandes,
Adam of Bremen, Alcuin, Widukind, and
the monks of St. Gall, assert of other German
races, Beda asserts of the Anglosaxons also, viz.
that they worshiped idols<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c008'><sup>[611]</sup></a>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>idola</i>, <i>simulacra deorum</i></span>;
and this he affirms not only upon the authority
of his general informants and of unbroken
tradition, but of Gregory himself. Upon the same
authority also he tells us that the heathen were
wont to sacrifice many oxen to their gods<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c008'><sup>[612]</sup></a>. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Beda himself we owe the information that Hréðe
and Eostre, two Saxon goddesses, gave their names
to two of the months; that at a certain season cattle
were vowed, and at another season cakes were
offered to the gods<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c008'><sup>[613]</sup></a>. From him also we learn that
upon the death of Sǽbeorht in Essex, his sons restored
the worship of idols in that kingdom<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c008'><sup>[614]</sup></a>; that
Eádwini of Northumberland offered thanks to his
deities for the safe delivery of his queen<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c008'><sup>[615]</sup></a>; that
Rǽdwald of Eastanglia sacrificed victims to his
gods<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c008'><sup>[616]</sup></a>; that, on occasion of a severe pestilence, the
people of Essex apostatized and returned to their
ancient worship<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c008'><sup>[617]</sup></a>, till reconverted by Gearoman,
under whose teachings they destroyed or deserted
the fanes and altars they had made; that incantations
and spells were used against sickness<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c008'><sup>[618]</sup></a>;
that certain runic charms were believed capable of
breaking the bonds of the captive<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c008'><sup>[619]</sup></a>; that Eorcenberht
of Kent was the first who completely put
down heathendom in his kingdom, and destroyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>the idols<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c008'><sup>[620]</sup></a>; lastly that at the court of Eádwini of
Northumberland there was a chief priest<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c008'><sup>[621]</sup></a>, and, as
we may naturally infer from this, an organized
heathen hierarchy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The poenitentials of the church and the acts of
the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">witena-gemóts</span> are full of prohibitions directed
against the open or secret practice of heathendom<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c008'><sup>[622]</sup></a>;
from them we learn that even till the time of Cnut,
well-worship and tree-worship, the sanctification
of places, spells, philtres and witchcraft, were still
common enough to call for legislative interference;
and the heavy doom of banishment, proclaimed
against their upholders, proves how deeply rooted
such pagan customs were in the minds of the people.
Still in the Ecclesiastical History of Beda, in
the various works which in later times were founded
upon it and continued it, in the poenitentials and
confessionals of the church, in the acts of the secular
assemblies, we look in vain for the sacred
names in which the fanes were consecrated, or for
even the slightest hint of the attributes of the gods
whose idols or images had been set up. Excepting
the cursory mention of the two female divinities already
noticed, and one or two almost equally rapid
allusions in later chronicles, we are left almost entirely
without direct information respecting the
tenants of the Saxon Pantheon. There are however
other authorities, founded on traditions more ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>than Beda himself, from which we derive more
copious, if not more definite accounts. First among
these are the genealogies of the Anglosaxon kings:
these contain a multitude of the ancient gods, reduced
indeed into family relations, and entered in
the grades of a pedigree, but still capable of identification
with the deities of the North and of Germany.
In this relation we find Wóden, Bældæg,
Geát, Wig, and Frea. The days of the week, also dedicated
to gods, supply us further with the names of
Tiw, Ðunor, Fricge and Sætere; and the names of
places in all parts of England attest the wide dispersion
of their worship. These, as well as the
names of plants, are the admitted signs by which
we recognize the appellations of the Teutonic gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>1. WÓDEN, in Old-norse OÞINN, in Old-german
WUOTAN.—The royal family of every Anglosaxon
kingdom, without exception, traces its
descent from Wóden through some one or other of
those heroes or demigods who are familiar to us
in the German and Scandinavian traditions<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c008'><sup>[623]</sup></a>. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the divinity of Wóden is abundantly clear: he is
both in form and in fact identical with the Norse
Oþinn and the German Wuotan, the supreme god
of all the northern races, whose divinity none will
attempt to dispute<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c008'><sup>[624]</sup></a>. Nor was this his character
unknown to our early chroniclers; Malmesbury,
speaking of Hengest and Hors, says: “They were
the great-great-grandsons of that most ancient Wóden,
from whom the royal families of almost all
the barbarous nations derive their lineage; whom
the nations of the Angles madly believing to be a
god, have consecrated unto him the fourth day of
the week, and the sixth unto his wife Frea, by a
sacrilege which lasts even unto this day<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c008'><sup>[625]</sup></a>.” Matthew
of Westminster<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c008'><sup>[626]</sup></a> and Geoffry of Monmouth<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c008'><sup>[627]</sup></a>
repeat this with characteristic variations, both adding,
apparently in the words of Tacitus<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c008'><sup>[628]</sup></a>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colimus
maxime Mercurium, quem Wóden lingua nostra
appellamus.</span>” Æðthelweard, an Anglosaxon nobleman
of royal blood, and thus himself a descendant
of Wóden, had previously stated the same thing
after the fashion of his own age,—the tenth century;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>he says of Hengest and Hors: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hi nepotes
fuere Uuoddan regis barbarorum, quem post, infanda
dignitate, ut deum honorantes, sacrificium
obtulerunt pagani, victoriae causa sive virtutis<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c008'><sup>[629]</sup></a>.</span>”
Again, he says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wothen, qui et rex multarum gentium,
quem pagani nunc ut deum colunt aliqui.</span>”
Thus, according to him, Wóden was worshiped as
the giver of victory, and as the god of warlike valour.
And such is the description given by Adam
of Bremen of the same god, at Upsala in Sweden:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hoc templo, quod totum ex auro paratum est,
statuas trium deorum veneratur populus, ita ut
potentissimus eorum Thór in medio solum habeat
triclinium, hinc et inde locum possident Wódan
et Fricco. Quorum significationes eiusmodi sunt:
Thór, inquiunt, praesidet in aere, qui tonitrus et
fulmina, ventos imbresque, serena et fruges gubernat.
Alter Wódan, id est <em>Fortior</em>, bella regit,
hominumque ministrat virtutem contra inimicos.
Tertius est Fricco, pacem voluptatemque largiens
mortalibus. Cuius etiam simulachrum fingunt ingenti
Priapo. Wódanem vero sculpunt armatum,
sicuti nostri Martem sculpere solent. Thór autem
cum sceptro Jovem exprimere videtur.</span>” The Exeter
book names Wóden in a similar spirit:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hǽðnum synne</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>that is, “For the heathen Wóden wrought the sin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>of idolatry, but the glorious almighty God the
spacious skies:” and an early missionary is described
to have thus taught his hearers: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wóden
vero quem principalem deum crediderunt et praecipuum
Angli, de quo originem duxerant, cui et
quartam feriam consecraverant, hominem fuisse
mortalem asseruit, et regem Saxonum, a quo plures
nationes genus duxerant. Huius, inquit, corpore in
pulverem resoluto, anima in inferno sepulta aeternum
sustinet ignem</span><a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c008'><sup>[631]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>To Wóden was dedicated the fourth or mid-day
of the week, and it still retains his name: this
among other circumstances tends to the identification
of him with Mercurius<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c008'><sup>[632]</sup></a>. The Old-norse
Rúnatale þáttr which introduces Oþinn declaring
himself to be the inventor of runes<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c008'><sup>[633]</sup></a>, is confirmed
by the assertion in the dialogue of Salomon and
Saturn, which to the question “Who invented letters?”
answers, “I tell thee, Mercury the giant”—that
is, “Wóden the god:” and this is further evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>of resemblance. A metrical homily in various
collections, bearing the attractive title <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De falsis
diis</cite></span>, supplies us with further proof of this identification,
not only with Wóden, but with the Norse
Oþinn: it says,</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>Thus we have Mercurius, Wóden and Oþinn sufficiently
identified. A careful investigation of the
inner spirit of Greek mythology has led some
very competent judges to see a form of Hermes in
Odysseus. This view derives some corroboration
from the Teutonic side of the question, and the relation
in which Wóden stands to Mercurius. Even
Tacitus had learnt that Ulixes had visited Germany,
and there founded a town which he called Asciburgium<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c008'><sup>[635]</sup></a>;
and without insisting on the probability
that Asciburgium grew out of a German Anseopurc
or a Scandinavian Asgard, it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that some tales of Wóden had
reached the ears of the Roman, which seemed to
him to resemble the history of Odysseus and his
wanderings. Such a tale we yet possess in the adventures
of Thorkill on his journey to Utgardaloki,
narrated by Saxo Grammaticus, which bears a remarkable
likeness to some parts of the Odyssey<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c008'><sup>[636]</sup></a>;
and when we consider Saxo’s very extraordinary
mode of rationalizing ancient mythological traditions,
we shall admit at least the probability of an
earlier version of the tale which would be much
more consonant with the suggestion of Tacitus,
although this earlier form has unfortunately not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>survived. Wóden is, like Odysseus, preeminently
the <em>wanderer</em>; he is Gangradr, Gangleri, the restless,
moving deity. Even the cloak, hood or hat
in which Oþinn is always clad<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c008'><sup>[637]</sup></a> reminds us both of
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>petasus</i></span> of Hermes and the broad hat which
Odysseus generally wears on ancient gems and
pottery. That Wóden was worshiped <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>æt wega
gelǽtum</i></span>, and that he was the peculiar patron of
boundaries, again recalls to us this function of
Hermes, and the Ἔρμαια. When we hear that offerings
were brought to him upon the lofty hills, we
are reminded that there was an ἄκριος, or Mountain
Hermes too, though little known; and the Ἑρμῆς
προμάχος, perhaps as little known as his mountain
brother, answers to the warlike, victory-giving
deity of our forefathers in his favourite form.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the godlike or heroic sons of Wóden descend
all the races qualified to reign, and some of
those whose names are found in the Anglosaxon
genealogies may be easily recognised in the mythological
legends of the continent. In some one or
other of his forms he is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>eponymus</i></span> of tribes and
races: thus, as Geát or through Geát, he was the
founder of the Geátas; through Gewis, of the Gewissas;
through Scyld, of the Scyldingas, the Norse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Skjoldungar; through Brand, of the Brondingas;
perhaps through Bætwa, of the Batavians<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c008'><sup>[638]</sup></a>. It seems
indeed not wholly improbable that every name in
the merely mythical portion of the genealogies represents
some particular tribe, under the distinctive
appellation of its tutelar god or hero; and that we
may thus be led in some degree to a knowledge of
the several populations which coalesced to form the
various kingdoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Legends describing the adventures of Wóden
either in a godlike or heroic form were probably
not wanting here, or in Germany; it is only in
Scandinavia that a portion of these have been preserved,
unless the tales of Geát and Sceaf, to be
hereafter noticed, are in reality to be referred to
him. Equally probable is it that he had in this
country temples, images and religious rites, traces
of which we find upon the continent<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c008'><sup>[639]</sup></a>; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>trees, animals and places were consecrated to him<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c008'><sup>[640]</sup></a>.
So numerous indeed are the latter, so common in
every part of England are names of places compounded
with his name, that we must admit his
worship to have been current throughout the island:
it seems impossible to doubt that in every quarter
there were localities (usually rising ground) either
dedicated to him, or supposed to be under his especial
protection; and thus that he was here, as
in Germany, the supreme god whom the Saxons,
Franks and Alamans concurred in worshiping. The
following names of places may all be unhesitatingly
attributed to this cause, and they attest the general
recognition and wide dispersion of Wóden’s
influence.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Wanborough</em>, formerly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbeorh</i></span>, in Surrey, lat.
51° 14´ N., long. 38´ W., placed upon the water-shed
which throws down streams to north and south,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>and running from east to west, divides the county
of Surrey into two nearly equal portions, once perhaps
two petty kingdoms; the range of hills now
called the Hog’s-back. It is a little to the north
of the ridge, nearly on the summit; the springs of
water are peculiarly pure and never freeze. In all
probability it has been in turn a sacred site for
every religion that has been received in Britain.
<em>Wanborough</em>, formerly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbeorh</i></span> in Wiltshire,
lat. 51° 33´ N., long. 1° 42´ W., about 3½ miles
S.E. of Swindon, placed upon the watershed which
throws down the Isis to the north, and Kennet to
the south. <em>Woodnesborough</em>, formerly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbeorh</i></span>,
in Kent, lat. 51° 16´ N., long. 1° 29´ E., throwing
down various small streams to north and south,
into the Stour and the sea. <em>Wonston</em> (probably <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesstán</i></span>)
in Hampshire, lat. 51° 10´ N., long. 1° 20´
W., from which small streams descend to north and
south, into the Test and Itchen. <em>Wambrook</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbróc</i></span>) in Dorsetshire. <em>Wampool</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnespól</i></span>) in Cumberland. <em>Wansford</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesford</i></span>) in Northamptonshire. <em>Wansford</em>
in the East Riding of Yorkshire. <em>Wanstead</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesstede</i></span>) an old Roman station in Essex.
<em>Wanstrow</em>, formerly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnestreów</i></span>
<em>Wanborough</em> or <em>Warnborough</em>, formerly <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbeorh</i></span>,
two parishes in Hampshire. <em>Wembury</em>, formerly
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesbeorh</i></span>, in Devonshire. <em>Wonersh</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesersc</i></span>), a parish at the foot of the Hog’s-back,
a few miles from Wanborough. <em>Wansdike</em>, formerly
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wódnesdíc</i></span>, an ancient dike or fortification, perhaps
the boundary between different kingdoms: it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>extended in a direction from east to west through
more than one of our southern counties. Its remains
are visible three or four miles W.S.W. of
Malmesbury in Wiltshire, and it crosses the northern
part of Somerset from the neighbourhood of Bath
to Portshead on the Bristol Channel, where it ends
in lat. 51° 29´ N., long. 2° 47´ W.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these references, which might be
made far more numerous, if necessary, we have
many instances in the boundaries of charters, of
trees, stones and posts set up in Wóden’s name,
and apparently with the view of giving a religious
sanction to the divisions of land. In this, as in
other respects, we find a resemblance to Hermes.
It is also to be borne in mind that many hills or
other natural objects may in fact have been dedicated
to this god, though bearing more general
names, as Ósbeorh, Godeshyl and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the names of Odin in the Old-norse mythology
is <em>Osk</em>, which by an etymological law is
equivalent to the German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Wunsch</i></span>, the Anglosaxon
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wisc</i></span>, and the English <em>Wish</em>. Grimm has shown
in the most convincing manner that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Wunsch</i></span> may
be considered as a name of Wuotan in Germany<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c008'><sup>[641]</sup></a>;
and it is probable that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wúsc</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wísc</i></span> may have had
a similar power here. Among the names in the
mythical genealogies we find Wúscfreá, <em>the lord of
the wish</em>, and I am even inclined to the belief that
Oisc, equivalent to Ésk, the founder of the Kentish
line of kings, may be a Jutish name of Wóden
in this form,—ésc, or in an earlier form óski, <i>i. e.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Wunsch, Wýsc<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c008'><sup>[642]</sup></a>. In Devonshire to this day all
magical or supernatural dealings go under the common
name of <em>Wishtness</em>: can this have any reference
to Wóden’s name Wýsc? So again a bad or
unfortunate day is a <em>wisht</em> day: perhaps a diabolical,
heathen, accursed day. There are several places
which appear to be compounded with this name;
among them: <em>Wishanger</em> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíschangra</i></span> or Wóden’s
meadow), one, about four miles S.W. of Wanborough
in Surrey, and another near Gloucester;
<em>Wisley</em> (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíscleáh</i></span>) also in Surrey; <em>Wisborough</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíscbeorh</i></span>) in Sussex; <em>Wishford</em> (probably
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wíscford</i></span>) in Wiltshire.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. ÞUNOR, in Old-norse ÞORR, in Old-german
DONAR.—The recognition of Ðunor in England
was probably not very general at first: the settlement
of Danes and Norwegians in the ninth and
following centuries may have extended it in the
northern districts. But though his name is not
found in the genealogies of the kings, there was
an antecedent probability that some traces of his
worship would be found among the Saxons. Thunar
is one of the gods whom the Saxons of the continent
were called upon to renounce, and a total
abnegation of his authority was not to be looked
for even among a race who considered Wóden as
the supreme god. That the fifth day of the week
was called by his name is well known: Thursday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>is <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðunres dæg</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dies Jovis</i></span>; and he is the proper
representative of Jupiter, inasmuch as he must be
considered in the light of the thundering god, an
elemental deity, powerful over the storms, as well
as the fertilizing rains<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c008'><sup>[643]</sup></a>. His peculiar weapon, the
mace or hammer, seems to denote the violent,
crushing thunderbolt, and the Norse myth represents
it as continually used against the giants or
elemental gods of the primal world. In a composition
whose antiquity it is impossible to ascertain,
we may still discover an allusion to this
point: in the Christian Ragna Ravk, or <em>Twilight of
the Gods</em>, it was believed that a personal conflict
would take place between the divinity and a devil,
the emissary and child of Satan: in the course of
this conflict, it is said: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">se Ðunor hit þyrsceð mid
ðǽre fýrenan æxe,</span>” the thunder will thresh it with
the fiery axe<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c008'><sup>[644]</sup></a>; and I am inclined to see a similar
allusion in the Exeter Book, where the lightning
is called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>rynegiestes wæpn</i></span>, the weapon of Avkv
Ðórr, the <em>car-borne god</em>, Thunder<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c008'><sup>[645]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The names of places which retain a record of
Ðunor are not very numerous, but some are found:
among them <em>Thundersfield</em>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðunresfeld</span>, in Surrey<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c008'><sup>[646]</sup></a>;
<em>Thundersley</em>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðunresleáh</span>, in Essex, near Saffron
Walden; <em>Thundersley</em>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðunresleáh</span>, also in Essex,
near Raylegh, and others in Hampshire<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c008'><sup>[647]</sup></a>. Near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Wanborough in Surrey is <em>Thursley</em>, which may have
been a Ðunresleáh also: it is unlikely that it was
ever Ðóresleáh, from Ðórr (the Norse form of Ðunor),
but it might have been Ðyrsleáh, the meadow
of the giant or monster. Very near Thursley is a
hill called <em>Thunder hill</em>, probably <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðunres hyl</span>. A similar
uncertainty hangs over <em>Thurleigh</em> in Bedfordshire,
<em>Thurlow</em> in Essex, <em>Thursby</em> in Cumberland,
<em>Thursfield</em> in Staffordshire, and <em>Thursford</em> in Norfolk<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c008'><sup>[648]</sup></a>.
The name of Ðunor was, to the best of my
knowledge, never borne by any man among the
Anglosaxons, which is in some degree an evidence
of its high divinity. The only apparent exception
to this assertion is found in an early tale which
bears throughout such strong marks of a mythical
character as to render it probable that some legend
of Ðunor was current in England; especially as its
locality is among the Jutish inhabitants of Kent.
According to this account, Ecgbert the son of Eorcenberht,
the fourth Christian king of Kent, had
excluded his cousins from the throne, and fearing
their popularity determined on removing them by
violence. The thane Thuner divined and executed
the intentions of his master. Under the king’s own
throne were the bodies concealed; but a light from
heaven which played about the spot revealed the
crime: the king paid to their sister the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wergyld</span> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>the slain princes: a hind, let loose, defined the boundaries
of the grant which was to make compensation
for the murder: forty-eight hides of land thus became
the property of Domneva, and the repentant
king erected upon them a monastery. The assassin
Thuner, however, added to his guilt the still higher
atrocity of sneering at the king’s repentance and its
fruits: the earth suddenly opened beneath his feet
and swallowed him; while the church placed the
names of his victims, Æðelred and Æðelberht, on
the list of its martyrs. Any comment upon this, as
a historical transaction, would be perfectly superfluous,
but it may possibly contain some allusion of
a mythological nature; for it seems that the very
fact of Ðunor’s not being a god generally worshiped
in England, would render him likely to form the
foundation of heroic stories. I will not absolutely
say that the dragon-slaughter of Beówulf is a direct
reference to the myth of Ðunor, though this
is possible. Another hero of Anglosaxon tradition
bears the name of the “Wandering Wolf;” he slew
five-and-twenty dragons at daybreak, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">on dæg-ræd;</span>”
and fell dead from their poison, as Thórr does
after slaying Midgard’s orm, and Beówulf after his
victory over the firedrake. The wolf however is a
sacred beast of Wóden, and these names of Wandering
wolf, Mearcwulf, etc. may have some reference
to him, especially as we learn from Grimm
that in some parts of Denmark the wild huntsman,
who is unquestionably Wóden, bears the name of
the flying Marcolf<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c008'><sup>[649]</sup></a>. The heathen character of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>whole relation is proved by the fact of the “famous
sailor on the sea,” the “wandering wolf” being
represented as the friend of Nebrond, probably
Nimrod<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c008'><sup>[650]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the names by which Ðunor is known in
Germany is Hamar<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c008'><sup>[651]</sup></a>, which was perhaps originally
derived from his weapon. This has become almost
synonymous with <em>devil</em>. Perhaps the same allusion
lurks in one or two names of places in England:
in the immediate neighbourhood of Thursley in
Surrey, and at a short distance from Thunderhill,
are some ponds known by the name of the <em>Hammer-ponds</em>.
It is remarkable that within two or three
miles of Thursley and the Hammer-ponds, three
singular natural mounds which form most conspicuous
objects upon a very wild and desert heath,
should bear the name of the Devil’s Jumps, while
at a short distance a deep valley is known by that
of the Devil’s Punchbowl, probably at some early
period, the Devil’s Cup, Ðunres-cup or the Hamar-cup.
The word Hamarden occurs in the boundaries
of charters<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c008'><sup>[652]</sup></a>; and other places recall the same
name: thus <em>Hameringham</em> in Lincoln, <em>Hamerton</em> in
Huntingdon, <em>Homerton</em> in Middlesex (hardly <em>Hammersmith</em>
in Middlesex), <em>Hamerton Green</em> in Yorkshire,
<em>Hamerton Kirk</em> in Yorkshire, <em>Hammerwick</em> in
Staffordshire.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. TIW, the Old-norse TYR, and Old-german
ZIU.—The third day of the week bears among us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>the name of the god Tíw, the Old-norse Týr. In
like manner we find him also giving his name to
places. In the neighbourhood so often referred to
in this chapter, and which seems to have been a
very pantheon of paganism<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c008'><sup>[653]</sup></a>, not far from Thursley
or from Wanborough, we find <em>Tewesley</em>, which I
have no scruple to pronounce the ancient Tíwesleáh.
Tísleáh<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c008'><sup>[654]</sup></a> seems to denote the same name, and
it is probable that even a race acknowledged this
god as its founder,—the Tiwingas, who gave their
name to <em>Tewing</em> in Herts. <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Tiwes mére</span><a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c008'><sup>[655]</sup></a> seems to
be the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>mere</i></span> or lake of Tiw, and in another charter
we have also Teówes þorn<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c008'><sup>[656]</sup></a>, which goes far towards
substantiating the German form Ziu.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Anglosaxon glossaries are perfectly accurate
when they give the rendering <em>Mars</em> for Tíw<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c008'><sup>[657]</sup></a>, and
Tíwesdæg is rightly <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dies Martis</i></span>. It cannot be
doubted that our forefathers worshiped this god,
as a supreme giver of victory, and especially a god
of battle, in some parts of Scandinavia and Germany;
whether or not in England appears doubtful.
In the mythology of the North he is the bravest of
the gods, the one who did not scruple to place his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>hand in the mouth of the wolf Fenris, when he demanded
a pledge that the gods would unbind the
chain they had forged for him, and on their breach
of faith Týr paid the penalty<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c008'><sup>[658]</sup></a>. The Roman historian
tells of the Hermunduri having vowed to
sacrifice the beaten Catti to Mercury and Mars, by
which vow the whole of the horses and men belonging
to the defeated force were devoted to
slaughter. Jornandes says of the Goths, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Martem
semper asperrima placavere cultura; nam victimae
ejus mortes fuere captorum, opinantes bellorum
praesulem aptius humani sanguinis effusione placatum<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c008'><sup>[659]</sup></a>.</span>”
Procopius tells the same tale of his Θουλίται,
that is the Scandinavians: τῶν δὲ ἱερείων σφίσι
τὸ κάλλιστον ἄνθρωπος ἐστιν, ὅνπερ ἂν δοριάλωτον ποιήσαιντο
πρῶτον· τοῦτον γὰρ τῷ Ἄρει θύουσιν, ἐπεὶ θεὸν
αὐτὸν νομίζουσι μέγιστον εἶναι<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c008'><sup>[660]</sup></a>. The Norse traditions,
although they acknowledge Oþinn as the giver of
victory, are still very explicit as to Týr: he is particularly
Wígaguð, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deus praeliorum</i></span>, and an especial
granter of success in battle, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">rǽðr miöc sigri í
orostom<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c008'><sup>[661]</sup></a>.</span>” Perhaps the Tencteri may be added to
the number of those who paid an especial honour
to Týr (in German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ziu</span>), since Tacitus makes them
say, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">communibus deis et praecipuo deorum Marti
grates agimus<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c008'><sup>[662]</sup></a>,</span>” where it is not at all necessary to
suppose Wóden is meant; and Grimm has good reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>to number the Suevi among the worshipers of
Ziu<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c008'><sup>[663]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Anglosaxon runic alphabet, which in several
letters recalls the names or attributes of the ancient
gods, uses Tír for T: the German runes wanting
a Z = T, apply Ziu: there is however another
rune, similar in shape to the runic T, but having
the power of EA; this bears the name of Ear, but
sometimes also in MSS. that of Tír: there are etymological
grounds on which the word Tír, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>gloria</i></span>,
must be connected with Tíw, and we are hence led
to the supposition that Ear may have been another
name for that god. This gains a great importance
when we bear in mind that in some parts of south
Germany, the third day of the week is called, not
Zistag, but Ertag, Eritag, Erichtag, for which we
should indeed have expected Erestag: and when
we find in Saxon Westphalia an undeniably heathen
spot called Eresburg, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Mons Martis</i></span>, now Mersberg,
i. e. Eresberg, the hill of Er, Ziu or Mars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the Anglosaxon poem on the runic characters
has something to tell us of Ear. It says of him,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>that is, “Ear is a terror to every man, when fast
the flesh, the corpse beginneth to become cold and
pale to seek the earth for a consort. Joy faileth,
pleasure departeth, engagements cease.” It is clear
that Ear, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spica</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>arista</i></span>, will not explain this, and we
may believe that our forefathers contemplated the
personal intervention of some deity whose contact
was death. This may have been Tíw or Ear, especially
in the battle-field, and here he would be equivalent
to the Ἄρης βροτολοιγός μιαιφόνος of Homer.</p>

<p class='c001'>More than this we shall hardly succeed in
rescuing: but there yet remains a name to consider,
which may possibly have tended to banish the more
heathen one of Tíw. Among all the expressions
which the Anglosaxons used to denote a violent
death, none is more frequent than wíg fornam, or
wíg gesceód, in which there is an obvious personality,
Wíg (<em>War</em>) ravished away the doomed: here
no doubt <em>war</em> was represented as personally intervening,
and slaying, as in other similar cases we
find the feminines <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hild, Gúð</span>, which are of the same
import, and the masculines <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swylt, Deáð</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mors</i></span>. The
abstract sense which also lay in the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wíg</i></span>, and
enabled it to be used without offence to Christian
ears, may have been a reason for its general adoption
in cases where at an earlier period Tíw would
have been preferred. Old glossaries give us the
rendering Wíg <em>Mars</em>, and Hild, <em>Bellona</em>: it is therefore
not at all improbable that these words were
purposely selected to express what otherwise must
have been referred to a god of perilous influence:
Wíg was a more general, and therefore less dangerous
name than Tíw, to <a id='corr354.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='recal'>recall</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_354.33'><ins class='correction' title='recal'>recall</ins></a></span> to the memory of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>people prone to apostasy. That the latter survived
in the name of a weekday serves only to show that it
was too deeply grounded to be got rid of; perhaps its
very familiarity in that particular relation rendered
it safe to retain the name of any deity, as was done
by five out of the seven days. But Christianity
was tolerant of heathen names in other than heathen
functions, and in the genealogy of the kings
of Wessex, Wíg is the father of Gewis, the eponymus
of the race. I have already expressed my belief
that this name represented either Wóden or
Tíw, and think it very likely that it was the latter,
inasmuch as the paganism of the Gewissas seems to
have been remarkable, beyond that of other Anglosaxon
tribes: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed Britanniam perveniens, ac primum
Gewissorum gentem ingrediens, cum omnes

<p class='c021'>FREÁ, in Old-norse FREYR, in Old-german
FRO.—The god whom the Norse mythology celebrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>under the name of Freyer must have borne
among us the name of Freá. It is probable that he
enjoyed a more extensive worship in all parts of
Europe than we can positively demonstrate. At
present we are only enabled to assert that the principal
seat of his worship was at Upsala among the
Swedes. In general there is not much trace in the
North of phallic gods; but an exception must be
made at once in the case of Freyr. One of the
most beautiful poems of the Edda<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c008'><sup>[668]</sup></a> tells how Freyr
languished for desire of the beautiful Gerdr; it was
for her love that he lost the sword, the absence of
which brings destruction upon him in the twilight
of the Gods. The strongest evidence of his peculiar
character is found in the passage already cited
from Adam of Bremen<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c008'><sup>[669]</sup></a>, and what he says of the
shape under which Frea was represented at Upsala:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tertius est Fricco, pacem, voluptatemque largiens
mortalibus; cujus etiam simulachrum fingunt ingenti
Priapo.</span>” The fertilizing rains, the life-bringing
sunshine, the blessings of fruitfulness and peace
were the peculiar gifts of Freyr<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c008'><sup>[670]</sup></a>; and from Adam
of Bremen again we learn that he was the god of
marriage: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si nuptiae celebrandae sunt, sacrificia
offerunt Fricconi.</span>” In his car he travelled through
the land, accompanied by a choir of young and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>blooming priestesses<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c008'><sup>[671]</sup></a>, and wherever he came plenty
and peace abounded. The beast sacred to Freyr
was the boar, and it is not improbable that various
customs and superstitions connected with this animal
may have had originally to do with his worship.
It is not going too far to assert that the
boar’s head which yet forms the ornament of our
festive tables, especially at Christmas, may have
been inherited from heathen days, and that the
vows made upon it, in the middle ages, may have
had their sanction in ancient paganism. But it is
as an amulet that we most frequently meet with the
boar in Anglosaxon. Tacitus says of the Æstyi,
that, in imitation of the Suevish custom, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Matrem
deum venerantur; insigne superstitionis, formas
aprorum gestant. Id pro armis omnium que tutela;
securum deae cultorem etiam inter hostes praestat</span><a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c008'><sup>[672]</sup></a>.”
The relation between Freá and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Mater
deorum</i></span> is a near one. Now the Anglosaxon poems
consider a boar’s form or figure so essential a portion
of the helmet, that they use the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">eofor</span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>aper</i></span>part of the armour:</p>

<p class='c018'>Grimm citing this passage goes so far as even to
render “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">freá wrasnum</span>” by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Frothonis signis</i></span>, and thus
connects it at once with Frea<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c008'><sup>[676]</sup></a>; and we may admit
at all events the great plausibility of the suggestion.
But though distinct proof of Freá's worship
in England cannot be supplied during the Saxon
period, we have very clear evidence of its still subsisting
in the thirteenth century. The following
extraordinary story is found in the Chronicle of
Lanercost<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c008'><sup>[677]</sup></a>, an. 1268. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro fidei divinae integritate
servanda recolat lector quod, cum hoc anno
in Laodonia pestis grassaretur in pecudes armenti,
quam vocant usitate Lungessouth, quidam bestiales,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>habitu claustrales non animo, docebant idiotas patriae
ignem confrictione de lignis educere et simulachrum
Priapi statuere, et per haec bestiis succurrere.
Quod cum unus laicus Cisterciencis apud
Fentone fecisset ante atrium aulae, ac intinctis
testiculis canis in aquam benedictam super animalia
sparsisset, ac pro invento facinore idolatriae
dominus villae a quodam fideli argueretur,
ille pro sua innocentia obtendebat, quod ipso nesciente
et absente fuerant haec omnia perpetrata,
et adiecit, et cum ad usque hunc mensem Junium
aliorum animalia languerent et deficerent, mea

duo vel tria, ita quod agricultui pauca supersunt.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>Fourteen years later a similar fact is stated to
have occurred in a neighbouring district, at Inverkeithing,
in the present county of Fife.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Insuper hoc tempore apud Inverchethin, in
hebdomada paschae [Mar. 29-Ap. 5], sacerdos
parochialis, nomine Johannes, Priapi prophana parans,
congregatis ex villa puellulis, cogebat eas,
choreis factis, Libero patri circuire; ut ille feminas
in exercitu habuit, sic iste, procacitatis causa, membra
humana virtuti seminariae servientia super asserem
artificiata ante talem choream praeferebat,
et ipse tripudians cum cantantibus motu mimico
omnes inspectantes et verbo impudico ad luxuriam
incitabat. Hi, qui honesto matrimonio honorem
deferebant, tam insolente officio, licet reverentur
personam, scandalizabant propter gradus eminentiam.

<p class='c001'>It appears that this priest retained his benefice
until his death, which happened in a brawl about
a year later than the events described above; and
it is very remarkable that the scandal seems to
have been less at the rites themselves than at their
being administered by a person of so high a clerical
dignity. Grimm had identified Freyr or Frowo
with Liber: it will be observed that his train of
reasoning is confirmed by the name Liber Pater,
given in the chronicler’s recital. The union of the
<em>Needfire</em> with these Priapic rites renders it proper to
devote a few words to this particular superstition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The needfire, nýdfýr, New-german nothfeuer, was
called from the mode of its production, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>confrictione
de lignis</i></span>, and though probably common to the Kelts<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c008'><sup>[678]</sup></a>
as well as Teutons, was long and well known to all
the Germanic races at a certain period. All the
fires in the village were to be relighted from the
virgin flame produced by the rubbing together of
wood, and in the highlands of Scotland and Ireland
it was usual to drive the cattle through it, by way
of lustration, and as a preservative against disease<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c008'><sup>[679]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>But there was another curious ceremony connected
with the lighting of fires on St. John’s eve,—probably
from the context, on the 23rd of June. A
general reference for this may be made to Grimm’s
Mythologie, pp. 570-592, under the general heads
of Nothfeuer, Bealtine and Johannisfeuer; but the
following passage, which I have not seen cited before,
throws light on Grimm’s examples, and adds
some peculiarities of explanation. It is found in an
ancient MS. written in England and now in the
Harleian collection, No. 2345, fol. 50.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eius venerandam nativitatem cum gaudio celebrabitis;
dico eius nativitatem cum gaudio; non
illo cum gaudio, quo stulti, vani et prophani, amatores

turpibus et illicitis ludibus, commessationibus, et
ebrietatibus, cubilibus et impudicitiis intendentes

quae in vigilia sancti Johannis fieri solent, quorum
tria genera. In vigilia enim beati Johannis colligunt

et circuunt arva cum brandis. Tercium de rota
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>quam faciunt volvi: quod, cum immunda cremant,

in hoc tempore excitabantur ad libidinem
propter calorem, et volando per aera frequenter
spermatizabantur aquae, et tunc erat letalis, quia
quicumque inde bibebant, aut moriebantur, aut
grave morbum paciebantur. Quod attendentes philosophi,
iusserunt ignem fieri frequenter et sparsim

et quaecumque immundum reddiderunt fumum,
nam per talem fumum sciebant fugari dracones....

<p class='c001'>An ancient marginal note has <em>bonfires</em>, intending
to explain that word by the bones burnt on such
occasions. Grimm seems to refer this to the cult
of Baldr or Bældæg, with which he connects the
name Beltane; but taking all the circumstances
into consideration, I am inclined to attribute it
rather to Freá, if not even to a female form of the
same godhead, Fricge, the Aphrodite of the North.
Freá seems to have been a god of boundaries; probably
as the giver of fertility and increase, he gradually
became looked upon as a patron of the fields.
On two occasions his name occurs in such boundaries,
and once in a manner which proves some tree
to have been dedicated to him. In a charter of the
year 959 we find these words: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðonne andlang
herpaðes on Frigedæges treów,</span>”—thence along the
road to Friday’s (that is Frea’s) tree<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c008'><sup>[680]</sup></a>; and in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>similar document of the same century we have a
boundary running “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">oð ðone Frigedæg.</span>” There is
a place yet called Fridaythorpe, in Yorkshire. Here
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Frigedæg</span> appears to be a formation precisely similar
to <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Bældæg</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swæfdæg</span>, and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wægdæg</span>, and to mean
only <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Freá</span> himself.</p>

<p class='c021'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">BALDÆG</span>, in Old-norse <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">BALDR</span>, in Old-german
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">PALTAC</span>.—The appearance of Bældæg among
Wóden’s sons in the Anglosaxon genealogies, would
naturally lead us to the belief that our forefathers
worshiped that god whom the Edda and other legends
of the North term Baldr, the father of Brand,
and the Phœbus Apollo of Scandinavia. Yet beyond
these genealogies we have very little evidence
of his existence. It is true that the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>bealdor</i></span>
very frequently occurs in Anglosaxon poetry as a
peculiar appellative of kings,—nay even as a name
of God himself,—and that it is, as far as we know,
indeclinable, a sign of its high antiquity. This
word may then probably have obtained a general
signification which at first did not belong to it,
and been retained to represent a king, when it had
ceased to represent a god. There are a few places
in which the name of Balder can yet be traced:
thus Baldersby in Yorkshire, Balderston in Lancashire,
Bealderesleah and Baldheresbeorh in Wiltshire<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c008'><sup>[681]</sup></a>:
of these the two first may very likely have
arisen from Danish or Norwegian influence, while
the last is altogether uncertain. Save in the genealogies
the name Bældæg does not occur at all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>But there is another name under which the Anglosaxons
may possibly have known this god, and that
is Pol or Pal.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the year 1842 a very extraordinary and very
interesting discovery was made at <a id='corr364.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Merseburg?'>Merseberg</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_364.5'><ins class='correction' title='Merseburg?'>Merseberg</ins></a></span> upon
the spare leaf of a MS. there were found two metrical
spells in the Old-german language: these
upon examination were at once recognized not only
to be heathen in their character, but even to contain
the names of heathen gods, perfectly free from
the ordinary process of Christianization. The one
with which we are at present concerned is in the
following words:</p>

<p class='c001'>The general character of this poem is one well
known to us: there are many Anglosaxon spells of
the same description. What makes this valuable
beyond all that have ever been discovered, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>number of genuine heathen names that survive in
it, which in others of the same kind have been replaced
by other sanctions; and which teach us the
true meaning of those which have survived in the
altered form. In a paper read before the Royal
Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Grimm identified
Phol with Baldr<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c008'><sup>[682]</sup></a>, and this view he has further developed
in the new edition of his Mythology<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c008'><sup>[683]</sup></a>. It
is confirmatory of this view that we possess the
same spell in England, without the heathendom,
and where the place of the god Baldr is occupied
by that of our Lord himself. The English version
of the spell runs thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>The lord rade,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>and the foal slade;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He lighted</div>
      <div class='line in2'>and he righted;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>set joint to joint</div>
      <div class='line in2'>and bone to bone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>sinew to sinew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Heal, in the Holy Ghost’s name<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c008'><sup>[684]</sup></a>!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It will be admitted that this is something more
than a merely curious coincidence, and that it leads
to an induction of no little value. Now it appears
to me that we have reasonable ground to believe
our version quite as ancient and quite as heathen
as the German one which still retains the heathen
names, and that we have good right to suppose
that it once referred to the same god. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>then was this god named in England? Undoubtedly
Pol or Pal<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c008'><sup>[685]</sup></a>. Of such a god we have some
obscure traces in England. We may pass over
the Appolyn and Apollo, whom many of our early
romancers number among the Saxon gods, although
the confused remembrance of an ancient
and genuine divinity may have lurked under this
foreign garb, and confine ourselves to the names of
places hearing signs of Pol or Pal. Grimm has
shown that the dikes called Phalgraben in Germany
are much more likely to have been originally Pfolgraben,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>and his conclusion applies equally to Palgrave,
two parishes in Norfolk and Suffolk:—so
Wódnes Díc, and the Devil’s Dike between Cambridge
and Newmarket. Polebrooke in Northamptonshire,
Polesworth in Warwickshire, Polhampton
in Hants<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c008'><sup>[686]</sup></a>, Polstead in Suffolk, Polstead
close under Wanborough (<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wódnesbeorh</span>) in Surrey,—which
is remarkable for the exquisite beauty of
its springs of water,—Polsden in Hants, Polsdon
in Surrey, seem all of the same class. To these
we must add Polsley and Polthorn, which last
name would seem to connect the god with that particular
tree: last, but not least, we have in Poling,
in Sussex, the record of a race of Polingas, who
may possibly have carried up their genealogy to
Bældæg in this form.</p>

<p class='c001'>The myth of Baldr in the North is one of the
most beautiful and striking in the whole compass
of their mythology: it is to be lamented that no
trace of it remains in our own poems. Still Baldr’s
lay may not have been entirely without influence
upon the progress of Christianity among the Saxons,
if, as is probable, it resembled in its main features
the legend of the Scandinavians. For them he was
the god of light and grace, of splendour, manly excellence
and manly beauty. A prophecy that Baldr
would perish afflicted the gods; Frigga took an
oath from all created nature that no individual
thing would harm the pride of the Æsir, the darling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>of the Asyniar. A sprig of mistletoe, at that
time too young to enter into so solemn an obligation,
was alone, and fatally, excepted. The invulnerability
of the god induced him to offer himself
as a mark for the practice of his relatives and
friends. Maces, axes and spears fell innocuous
from his sacred frame; but Loki placed a sprig of
mistletoe in the hand of the blind Haudr<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c008'><sup>[687]</sup></a>, and
with this, the sole thing that could not be forsworn,
he slew his brother. An effort still remained to be
made. Oþinn himself descended to the abode of
Hel, in hopes of persuading the goddess of the dead
to relinquish her prey. He was successful, and returned
with the joyful intelligence that Baldr would
be restored to the gods, if all created nature would
weep for him. All nature did weep for the loss of
the god of beauty, save one old crone. When called
upon to do her part in his restoration she answered,
“What have the gods done for me, that I should weep
for Baldr? Let Hel keep her dead!” It is thought
that it was Loki who had assumed the old woman’s
form. Thus Baldr’s fate was sealed. The faithful
Nanna<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c008'><sup>[688]</sup></a> would not survive her beautiful lord, and
the gods and goddesses attended round the pile
on which their two cherished companions were reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>to dust together. But the slain god could
hope for no resurrection: his throne was placed
in the shadowy realm of Hel, and weeping virgins
spread the eternal pall that was to give dreary
honour to the god of light in the cold kingdom of
darkness and the invisible. The posthumous son,
or more likely re-birth, of the god, avenged his father
upon the wretched instrument of Loki’s wiles. Yet
those who had fathomed the deeper mysteries of the
creed knew well enough that Baldr was to rise again
in triumph: after the twilight of the gods and the
destruction of the ancient world, he was to return
in glory and joy, and reign in a world where there
should be neither sin nor sorrow, nor destruction.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of these details, the Anglosaxon mythology
knows nothing, in the forms which have survived:
and perhaps in this peculiar myth we may recognize
something of an astronomical character, which
can certainly not be attributed to other Northern
legends. However this may be, we must content
ourselves with the traces here given of Pol, as one
form of Baldr, and with the genealogical relation
which has been noticed. Meagre as these facts
undoubtedly are, they are amply sufficient to prove
that the most beloved of the Northern gods was
not altogether a stranger to their children in this
island. Perhaps the adoption of another creed
led to the absorption of this divinity into a person
of far higher and other dignity, which, while it
smoothed the way for the reception of Christianity,
put an end for ever to even the record of his sufferings.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>GEÁT, in Old-norse GAUTR, in Old-German
KÓZ.—A cursory allusion has already been made
to Geát, probably only another form of Wóden,
since in the mythology of the North, Oþinn is
Gaútr, but certainly the eponymus of the Geátas,
that tribe of whom Beówulf was the champion and
afterwards the king. Geát appears in the Westsaxon
genealogy as a progenitor of Wóden, but this
collocation is unimportant in mythological inquiries.
It is probable that Gapt, whom Jornandes
places at the head of the Gothic genealogy, is only
a misreading of Gavt, which is the equivalent

<p class='c018'>It is much to be regretted that this is all we learn
on this subject, which becomes very interesting when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>we remember how little trace there is of phallic
gods in the Northern mythology. But that Geát
was a god, and not merely a hero, is not left
entirely to inference: it is distinctly asserted by
various and competent authorities: Nennius has
declared him to have been <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>filius dei</i></span>, not indeed
the God of Hosts, and God of Gods, but of some
idol<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c008'><sup>[691]</sup></a>. But Asser, who was no doubt well acquainted
with the traditions of Ælfred’s family, says<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c008'><sup>[692]</sup></a>, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Quem
Getam dudum pagani pro deo venerabantur,</span>”
which is repeated in the same words by Florence of
Worcester<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c008'><sup>[693]</sup></a> and Simeon of Durham<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c008'><sup>[694]</sup></a>, and is contained
in a Saxon genealogy preserved in the Textus
Roffensis, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Geáta, ðene ða hǽðenan wurðedon
for God.</span>” We can therefore have no scruple about
admitting his divinity; and a comparison of the
Gothic and Scandinavian traditions proves the belief
in it to have been widely held. The name, which
is derived from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>geotan</i></span>, to pour, most probably denotes
only the special form in which Wóden was
worshipped by some particular tribes or families;
and the occurrence of it in the genealogies, only
the fact that such tribes or families formed part of
the national aggregates, to whose royal line it belongs.
But nevertheless we must admit the personality
attributed to him by those tribes, and the
probability of his having been, at least for them,
the national divinity. The circumstance of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>name having left such deep traces as we perceive
in the quotations given above, proves not only the
especial divinity of the person, but perhaps also the
political power and importance of the worshippers<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c008'><sup>[695]</sup></a>.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c021'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">SÆTERE.</span>—Among the Gods invariably mentioned
as having been worshipped by our forefathers
is one who answered to the Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saturnus</span>, at least
in name. From the seventh week-day we may infer
that his Anglosaxon name was <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Sætere</span>, perhaps
the <em>Placer</em> or <em>Disposer</em><a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c008'><sup>[696]</sup></a>; for <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Sæteresdæg</span> seems a
more accurate form than <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Sæternesdæg</span> which we
sometimes find. There are both names of places
and of plants formed upon the name of this god:
as Satterthwaite in Lancashire, Satterleigh in Devonshire
and Sæteresbyrig<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c008'><sup>[697]</sup></a> in the same county, of
which there appears to be no modern representative;
while among plants the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Gallicrus</i></span>, or common
crowfoot, is called in Anglosaxon Satorláðe. The
appearance of Saturnus as an interlocutor in such
a dialogue as the Salomon and Saturn<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c008'><sup>[698]</sup></a> is a further
evidence of divinity; so that, taking all circumstances
into account, it is probable that when Gregory
of Tours, Geoffry of Monmouth and others,
number him among the Teutonic gods, they are
not entirely mistaken. Now there has been a tradition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>in Germany at least, of a god Chródo, or
Hruodo, whose Latin name was Saturn, and whose
figure is said to have been that of an old man
standing upon a fish, and holding in one hand a
bundle of flowers, while the other grasps a wheel.
Grimm imagines herein some working of Slavonic
traditions<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c008'><sup>[699]</sup></a>, and following the Slavonic interpreters
connects this Chródo with Kirt or Sitivrat, and
again with some Sanskrit legend of a Satjavrata<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c008'><sup>[700]</sup></a>.
But the reasoning seems inconclusive, and hardly
sufficient to justify even the very cautions mode in
which Grimm expresses himself about this Slavo-Germanic
godhead<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c008'><sup>[701]</sup></a>. More than this we cannot say
of the Anglosaxon Sætere, whose name does not
appear in the royal genealogies; nevertheless we
cannot doubt the existence of some deity whom our
forefathers recognized under that name.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>From the Gods we pass to the Goddesses: of these
we have indeed but scanty record in England. Of
the great and venerable goddess Fricge, Wóden’s
wife, we are only told that she gave her name to
the sixth day of the week; and we must admit that
this is all we know of her, unless she be implied
under some other name, which is possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beda in acquainting us with the ancient names
of the Anglosaxon months tells us of four which
were called from their especial reference to the
gods: these are <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Solmónað</span> or February; <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hréðmónað</span>,
March; <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Eóstermónað</span>, April; and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Blótmónað</span>,
November. <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Solmónað</span> he says received its name
from the cakes which were offered to the gods at
that time<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c008'><sup>[702]</sup></a>; <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Blótmónað</span> from the victims (cattle) that
were vowed for sacrifice; of the others he says<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c008'><sup>[703]</sup></a>,
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hréðmónað</span> is called from a goddess of theirs,—Rheda,
to whom they sacrificed in that month.
<a id='corr374.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Eostermónað'>Eóstermónað</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_374.18'><ins class='correction' title='Eostermónað'>Eóstermónað</ins></a></span>, which is now interpreted by the
‘Paschal month,’ had its name of old from a goddess
of theirs named Eostre, to whom in this month
they offered celebrations.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Scandinavian and German mythology are
alike destitute of these names; although among
the many goddesses they recognize some two may
perhaps be identical with ours. The name Hréðe
may possibly mean <em>severe</em>, <em>fierce</em>, and denote a warlike
goddess; but still I am more inclined to connect
it with the adjective <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hróð</span>, glorious, famous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>and to see in it the meaning of the <em>great</em> or <em>glorious</em>
goddess, that is, in some form or other, Fricge,
Wóden’s wife: it is however not to be forgotten
that the German Chrodo, in Anglosaxon Hróð or
even Hréðe, is now admitted, and that this god
was in fact Saturn. It is true that we have more
than one fragmentary legend in which the name of
Saturn survives, but in a heroic rather than a godlike
form, and this may have been the cause of its
preservation: the Church found Saturn useful, and
kept him; nor is it at all surprising that a change
of sex should have taken place: the same thing
happened with the German goddess Nerthus, who
reappears in the Norse god Niördr, and the classical
scholar will at once remember the god Lunus, as
well as the goddess Luna<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c008'><sup>[704]</sup></a>. Whatever explanation
we may attempt to give of Hréðe, it is clear that
she was a Saxon goddess to whom at stated periods
sacrifice was offered. The same thing may be said
of Eóstre or Eástre, whose name must be etymologically
connected with Eást, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>oriens</i></span>, and who therefore
was in all probability a goddess of brightness
and splendour, perhaps also a Beorhte or Bright
goddess: she may have been a goddess of light, of
the morning beams, of the newly awakening year,
when the sun first begins to recover power after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>gloom and darkness of winter. That she was deeply
impressed upon the mind and feelings of the people
follows from her name having been retained for
the great festival of the church: it may also be
fairly argued that she was a mild and gentle divinity,
whom the clergy did not fear thus to commemorate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lye’s dictionary cites another goddess, Ricen,
with the translation Diana, which he seems to have
taken from some Cotton MS. It stands too isolated
for us to make any successful investigation,
but I may be excused for calling to mind the fact
that Diana is mentioned by the versifying chroniclers
as among the Saxon gods, and also that
the superstition known in Germany as the “Wild
Hunt,” and which is properly connected with Wóden,
goes very generally among us by the name of
Ludus Dianae. This, which became the foundation
of many a cruel persecution, under the name
of witchcraft, is spread over every part of Germany in
one form or another: sometimes it is [the daughter of]
Herodias who is compelled for ever to expiate her fatal
dancing; at other times we have Minerva or Bertha,
Holda, Habundia, Dame Abonde, Domina, Hera—the
Lady, and so on. It is true that our fragmentary
remains of Saxon heathendom do not contain any
immediate allusions to this superstition, but yet it
can scarcely be doubted that it did exist here as it
did in every part of the continent<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c008'><sup>[705]</sup></a>, and one therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>would not willingly decide at once against there
having been some deity who might be translated by
Diana in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>interpretatio Romana</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c021'>FIENDS and MONSTERS.—The community of
belief, between the Germans of this island, of the
continent, and their Scandinavian kinsmen, does
not appear to have been confined to the beneficent
gods of fertility or warlike prowess. In the noble
poem of Beowulf we are made acquainted with a
monstrous fiend, Grendel, and his mother, supernatural
beings of gigantic birth, stature and disposition,
voracious and cruel, feeding upon men, and
from their nature incapable of being wounded with
mortal weapons. The triumph of the hero over
these unearthly enemies forms the subject of one
half the poem. But Grendel, who, from the characteristics
given above, may at once be numbered
among the rough, violent deities of nature, the
Jotnar<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c008'><sup>[706]</sup></a> of the North and Titans of classical mythology,
is not without other records: in two or
three charters we find places bearing his name, and
it is remarkable that they are all connected more
or less with water, while the poem describes his
dwelling as a cavern beneath a lake, peopled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Nicors and other supernatural beings of a fiendish
character. The references are Grindles pyt<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c008'><sup>[707]</sup></a>, Grindles
bece<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c008'><sup>[708]</sup></a>, and Grendles mere<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c008'><sup>[709]</sup></a>. Grimm, by a comparison
of philological and other data, identifies
Grendel with the Norse Loki, the evil-bringer, and
in the end destroyer of the gods<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c008'><sup>[710]</sup></a>. The early converted
Anglosaxons who possessed another devil to
oppose to the Almighty in the Ragnaravkr<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c008'><sup>[711]</sup></a>, could
easily reconcile themselves to the destruction of
Grendel by an earthly hero; although the ancient
heathendom breaks out in the supernatural powers
attributed to the latter, and which placing him very
near the rank of the gods, induce a belief that Beówulf
contains only the shadow of an older myth
which may have been current far beyond the limits
of this island<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c008'><sup>[712]</sup></a>. It will be sufficient to call attention
to the many German tales in which the devil’s
mother figures as a principal actor, nay to our own
familiar expression, <em>the devil’s dam</em>, to show how
essential this characteristic of the fiend was: the
devil of the Church had certainly no mother; but
the old Teutonic evil spirit had, and Loki and
Grendel are alike in this. Even the religious view,
which naturally shaped itself to other influences,
could not escape the essential heathendom of this
idea: the devil who is so constant an agent in the
Anglosaxon legends, has, if not a mother, at least
a father, no less than Satan himself; but Satan lies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>bound in hell, as Loki lies bound, and it is only as
his emissary and servant that the devil his son<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c008'><sup>[713]</sup></a> appears
on earth, to tempt and to destroy. In Cædmon,
the legend of St. Andrew, Juliana, Gúðlác,
etc., it is always the devil’s son and satellite who
executes his work on earth, and returns to give an
account of his mission to him that sent him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus throughout the strange confusion which
besets all Anglosaxon compositions in which the
devil is introduced either as a tempter or a persecutor
of the holy and just, we may perceive a ray
of ancient heathendom, gloomy enough, no doubt,
but far less miserable than the vile materialism of
the notions with which it has been mixed up. The
rude <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Eoten</i></span> or Titan is not nearly so repugnant to
our Christian ideas as the gross corporeal fiends
who have grown out of him, and who play so conspicuous
a part in Anglosaxon hagiology or purgatorial
legends: nor is it easy to conceive any superstition
more degrading than that which Eastern or
perhaps even Roman traditions thus engrafted upon
the ancient creed. With these we are not called
upon to deal in any further detail, for though they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>have no claim whatever to be called Christian, they
certainly have nothing to do with Anglosaxon heathendom.
The Grendels and Nicors of our forefathers
were gods of nature, the spirits of the wood
and wave: they sunk into their degraded and disgusting
forms only when the devils of a barbarous
superstition came to be confounded and mixed up
with them. There is still something genuine and
poetical in the account which a monk of St. Gall
gives of the colloquy between the ancient gods
when the missionaries settled on the shores of the
lake of Constance; when in the dead of night, the
holy anchoret watching at his nets,</p>

<p class='c021'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Volvente deinceps cursu temporis, electus Dei
Gallus retia lymphae laxabat in silentio noctis, sed
inter ea audivit demonem de culmine montis pari
suo clamantem, qui erat in abditis maris. Quo respondente,
‘Adsum!’ montanus e contra: ‘Surge,’
inquit, ‘in adiutorium mihi! Ecce peregrini venerunt,
qui me de templo eiecerunt;’ nam Deos conterebant,
quos incolae isti colebant; insuper et eos ad
se convertebant; ‘Veni, veni, adiuva nos expellere
eos de terris!’ Marinus demon respondit: ‘En unus
illorum est in pelago, cui nunquam nocere potero.
Volui enim retia sua ledere, sed me victum proba
lugere. Signo orationis est semper clausus, nec
umquam somno oppressus.’ Electus vero Gallus
haec audiens, munivit se undique signaculo crucis,
dixitque ad eos: ‘In nomine Jesu Christi praecipio
vobis, ut de locis istis recedatis, nec aliquem hic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>ledere praesumatis!’ Et cum festinatione ad littus

dirae vocis audiebatur per culmina [montium<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c008'><sup>[714]</sup></a>].</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>But words are hardly strong enough to express
the feeling with which an educated mind contemplates
the fantastical, filthy and hideous images
which gross fanaticism strove to force into the service
of a religion whose end and means are love;
the material terrors which were substituted for the
sanctions of the most spiritual, pure and holy creed;
the vulgar, degrading and ridiculous phantasmagoria
devised to destroy the essential selfishness
and impurity of men, and startle them into justice
and righteousness of life! The Teutonic Titans,
though terrible from their rude strength, and dangerous
even to the gods themselves, are neither
disgusting nor degrading: they are like Chronos
and Saturn, full of power and wisdom; they are in
constant warfare with the gods, because the latter
are the representatives of a more humane order;
because the latter was more civilised: but as the
giant race were mighty at the beginning, so are they
to triumph at the end of the world; and it is only
when they shall have succeeded in destroying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>gods of Oþinn’s race, that they will themselves vanish
from the scene, and the glorious reign of Allfather
commence. Loki alone has something mean
and tricksey in his character, something allied to
falsehood—a slight spice of the Mephistopheles.
But it is not probable that this belongs to his earliest
form, and it appears rather to mark the deterioration
of a myth becoming popular, and assuming
traits of the popular, humorous spirit, which takes
delight in seeing power counteracted by cunning,
and revenges itself for the perfection of its heroes by
sometimes exposing them to ludicrous defeat. But
even Loki was at first the friend and associate of
the gods: he was united with them by the most
sacred bonds of brotherhood, and his skill and
wisdom secured them victory in many a dangerous
encounter. Like Lucifer, he had been a tenant of
heaven: why he and the gods ultimately parted in
anger we are not told; but we find him pursuing
them with the utmost malice, till at length he
causes the death of Baldr. He is then bound and
cast beneath the worlds, the poisonous snake hangs
over him distilling torturing venom: his faithful
wife sits by and catches the drops as they fall, but
when the vessel in which she receives them is full
and she turns for a moment to empty it, the deadly
juice reaches the prostrate god, and in his agony
he trembles in every limb. This convulsion is
known to men as the earthquake. It is only in the
twilight of the gods that he will break his chain and
lead the sons of Muspel to avenge him upon the
race of Oþinn.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>But Loki is no devil in the Anglosaxon sense of
Satan and his son; he is no deceiver or persecutor
of men; least of all is he their torturer in another
world. He suffers indeed, but like Prometheus, or
Entelechus, or Ægeon, and his hour of triumph is
to come. There is in his genuine character nothing
mean or little,—much indeed that is terrible, gloomy
and vague, but nothing ridiculous or disgusting.
The Saxon devil with horns, tail, cloven feet, sulphur
and pitch, torches, red-hot tongs, pincers and
pitchforks is less creditable to the imagination,
and more dangerous to the moral being, of his inventors.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor are the occupations of such a fiend less vulgar
than his form: he blasts the corn, wounds the
cattle, fetters the hands of the doomed, enters the
mouth of those who have not guarded it by the sign
of the cross, and in a future state becomes the
torturer—in the most material and mechanical way—of
those whose life has been spent in the service
of sin. The coarse fancy of Marlowe himself halts
after the descriptions of the Anglosaxon divines and
poets, revelling in this fruitful theme. Unpleasant
as such records are, and revolting to our sense of
right, it is necessary that we should know what was
taught or permitted by the clergy, if we are to know
anything of the mode of life and mode of belief of
our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c001'>As early even as the eighth century, we find so
great a man as Beda condescending to admit into
his ecclesiastical history, such melancholy evidence
of Manichæan materialism as the vision of Drihthelm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>He tells how such a man in Northumbria,
lying at the point of death, had fallen into a trance,
recovering from which and being restored to health,
he had entered the monastery of Melrose, in which
he continued till his death. During his trance he
had seen visions which he afterwards communicated
to Hamgisl a priest, Aldfríð king of the Northumbrians,
and others. He related that on being released
from the body his soul had been led by one,
bright of aspect, gloriously clothed, towards the
east, into a valley wide and deep and of a length
that seemed infinite: one side glowed terribly with
flames, the other was filled with furious hail and
freezing snow. Either side was full of human souls
which were tossed from left to right as by a tempest.
For when they could not bear the violence
of the immense heat, they rushed wretchedly into
the midst of the dreadful cold; and when they
could find no rest there, they sprung back again,
again to burn in the midst of inextinguishable
flames. When Drihthelm saw them thus eternally
tormented by a crowd of deformed demons, he
thought within himself, “This is surely hell, of
whose intolerable tortures I have often heard tell!”
But his companion said, “This is not the hell thou
thinkest!” and proceeding further, he beheld how
the darkness began to thicken around and fill the
whole space before him. Suddenly in this deep
night he perceived globes of dusky fire cast up from
what seemed to be a vast well, into which they
fell again, without intermission. In the midst of
these horrors his conductor left him. On looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>more intently, he now perceived that the tongues
of fire were all full of human souls, tossed aloft like
sparks in smoke, and then dragged back into the
abyss. And an incomparable stench, which bubbled
up with the vapours, filled all those abodes
of darkness. Around him sounded the shouts and
taunts of fiends, like a vulgar mob exulting over
a captive enemy: suddenly a host of evil spirits
dragged through the darkness five souls, one of a
laic, one of a woman, one tonsured like a cleric, and
plunged them into the abyss amidst a confused roar
of lamentation and laughter. Then certain malignant
spirits ascending from the deep, surrounded
the trembling spectator, terrifying him with their
flaming eyes and the fire which burst from their
mouths and noses, and threatening to seize him
with fiery pincers which they held in their hands.
From this danger he was rescued by the return of
his companion, who conducted him to two corresponding
regions of eternal bliss, every one of whose
details is in the strongest contrast to those already
described, but just as material, as gross and sensual.
The moral of this is too important to be
given in any but Beda’s own words. “And when,
on our return, we had reached those happy mansions
of spirits clothed in white, he said unto me,
‘Knowest thou what all these things are which
thou hast beheld?’ I answered, ‘No.’ Then said
he, 'The valley which thou sawest, horrible with
its boiling flames and its stiff cold, that is the place
where shall be tried and chastised the souls of those
men, who delaying to confess and to amend their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>sins, yet fly to penitence in the hour of death, and
thus leave the body: yet since they had confession
and penance even in death, shall all, at the day of
judgment, reach the kingdom of heaven. But
many, both the prayers of the living, and their alms
and fasts, and most of all the celebration of masses,
assist, so that they shall be freed even before the
day of judgment. But that flame-belching, putrid
well which thou hast seen is the mouth of hell itself,
into which whoever shall fall, shall never be
set free for ever and ever. And that flowery place
in which thou sawest those most beauteous youths
enjoy themselves in splendour, is that wherein are
received the souls of those who indeed leave the
body in good works, but yet are not of such perfection
that they may at once enter the kingdom of
heaven; who yet shall all, in the day of judgment,
enter into the sight of Christ, and the joys of the
heavenly kingdom. For they who are perfect in
every word and act and thought, immediately on
leaving the body shall reach the heavenly kingdom;
to whose precincts that place belonged, where
thou heardest the sound of pleasant singing, together
with the smell of sweetness and the splendour
of light<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c008'><sup>[715]</sup></a>.'” Having thus seen and heard, Drihthelm
was allowed to return to the body, where no doubt
he became a powerful champion of Purgatory.
But Beda is not satisfied with this tale: he goes
on to tell of a Mercian noble, who would not go
to confession. At the point of death, he sees two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>angels enter his room, bearing the record of his
good deeds, which fill but a small roll: having
caused him to read this, they make way for a
crowd of fiends, black and foul, who bear the enormous
tale of his sins of word, work and thought,
which also he is compelled to read. Then the leader
of the fiends turning to the sons of light exclaims,
“Why sit ye here, knowing assuredly that he is
ours?” to which they reply, “Ye say truly: take
him, and lead him with you into the accumulation of
your own damnation!” Upon this the good spirits
vanish, and two demons, a sort of Occidental Munkir
and Nekir, smite him with ploughshares on the
head and feet, and creep into him; when they meet
within him, he dies and passes into everlasting
torments<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c008'><sup>[716]</sup></a>. This tale, which Beda heard from the
venerable bishop Pecthelm<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c008'><sup>[717]</sup></a>, he refines upon, explains,
and finishes by declaring that he relates it
simply for the salvation of those who shall read
or hear it. No doubt the distempered ravings of
monks, made half mad by inhuman austerities, unnatural
restrictions, and wretched themes of contemplation,
would in themselves be of little worth:
we can comprehend the visions of a Saint Francis
de Salis, an Ignatius Loyola, a Peter the Hermit, a
Santa Theresa, and even more readily those of a
Drihthelm or a Madame Guyon: but how shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>we understand the record of them by a Beda or a
Fenelon?</p>

<p class='c001'>Such authority as this was likely to be followed
with zeal; once open, the career of unbridled fancy
was sure to find no limit; the more sure, since
then, as now, the fears and miseries of the mass
were sources of profit to the few. Then, as now,
there were rogues found who dared to step between
man and God, to clothe themselves in the coat
without seam, to make themselves the mediators
between eternal mercy and the perishing sinner.
Accordingly in later times we find variation upon
variation in the outline already so vigorously
sketched; William of Malmesbury furnishes an ample
field for collectors of this kind of literature. I shall
content myself here with citing from the so often
quoted Salomon and Saturn two passages, which to
me are redolent of heathendom, disguised after the
fashion which has been described.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again we are told, in the same composition:
“And when the devil is very weary he seeketh the
cattle of some sinful man, or an unclean tree; or
if he meeteth the mouth and body of a man that
hath not been blessed with the sign of the cross,
then goeth he into the bowels of the man who hath

flesh departeth into the earth, and from thence
findeth his way into the desert of hell<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c008'><sup>[720]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>NICOR.—To the class of elemental gods must
originally have been reckoned the Nicor, or water-spirit,
whose name has not only been retained in the
<em>Water Nixes</em> of our own country, and in the <em>Neck</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>of Germany, but in our own common name for the
devil, <em>Old Nick</em>. According to the account given in
Beówulf, these were supernatural, elvish creatures
haunting the lakes, rivers and seas, ever on the
watch to injure the wayfarer, and apparently endowed
with the power of creating tempests. In this
semi-Christian view they were fiendish and savage
enemies of the sailor, whom they pursued with horns
and tusks, dragged to the bottom of the waves and
then no doubt devoured<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c008'><sup>[721]</sup></a>. Probably, like other supernatural
beings dreaded by our forefathers, they
were included in the family of ogres and monsters
descended from the first homicide. Yet it may be
doubted whether this, was the original and heathen
sense of the word Nicor. As late as the thirteenth
century I find in an old German glossary Neckar
translated by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Neptunus</i></span>, the god of the sea; and it
is notorious that one of the names borne by Oþinn,
whenever he appears as a sea-god is Hnikuþr and
Nikuz. Hence it is not unlikely that in their
ancient creed, the pagan Saxons recognized Nicor
as Wóden. The name Hwala which occurs in the
genealogies, and like Geát may be assumed to be
only another name of Wóden, confirms this view.
Hwala is formed from <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hwæl</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cetus</i></span>, just as Scyldwa
is from Scyld, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>clypeus</i></span>, and was probably only a
name of Wóden as a sea-god. The danger attending
the whale or walrus fishery<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c008'><sup>[722]</sup></a> made the first at
least of these animals an object of superstitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>dread to the Anglosaxon sailor; perhaps, as in the
case of the bear, natural peculiarities which are
striking enough even to our more scientific eyes,
helped to give an exceptional character to the monarch
of the Northern seas. Be this as it may, it
is not without importance that Hwala should appear
in the genealogies among names many of which
are indisputably Wóden’s, that in Scandinavia and
Germany Nikuz or Necker should be names of the
sea-god, and that till a very late period,—when
the heathen gods had everywhere assumed the garb
of fiends and devils,—the Nicor should appear as
the monster of the deep <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>. The miraculous
power attributed to the Nicor,—in Beówulf
he is called “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">wundorlíc wǽgbora,</span>” a supernatural
bringer of the waves,—is in itself evidence of earlier
godhead; and in this sense I am disposed to identify
him with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>demon marinus</i></span> whom St. Gall defeated
by his constant watchfulness. In his altered and
degraded form we may also recognize the demon of
the lines lately cited, who stabs the horse with his
horns while crossing the water. The beautiful Nix
or Nixie who allures the young fisher or hunter to
seek her embraces in the wave which brings his
death, the Neck who seizes upon and drowns the
maidens who sport upon his banks, the river-spirit
who still yearly in some parts of Germany demands
tribute of human life, are all forms of the ancient
Nicor; but more genuine perhaps,—certainly more
pleasing,—is the Swedish Stromkarl, who from
the jewelled bed of his river, watches with delight
the children gambol in the adjoining meadows, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>singing sweetly to them in the evening, detaches
from his hoary hair the sweet blossoms of the
water-lily, which he wafts over the surface to their
hands.</p>

<p class='c021'>HEL.—Among the fearful beings whose power
was dreaded even by the gods, was Hel, mistress of
the cold and joyless under-world. Called, through
the fate of battle, to the glories of Wælheal, the
Teutonic or Norse hero trembled at a peaceful
death which would consign him to a dwelling
more desolate and wretched than even that which
awaited the fallen warriors of heroic Greece<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c008'><sup>[723]</sup></a>, and
many a legend tells of those whose own hand saved
them from a futurity so abhorred<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c008'><sup>[724]</sup></a>. But Hel was not
herself the agent of <em>death</em>; she only received those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>who had not earned their seat in Oþinn’s hall by a
heroic fall, and the Wælcyrian or Shieldmays were
the choosers of the slain. The realm of Hel was all
that Wælheal was not,—cold, cheerless, shadowy;
no simulated war was <em>there</em>, from which the combatants
desisted with renovated strength and glory;
no capacious quaighs of mead, or cups of the life-giving
wine; no feast continually enjoyed and miraculously
reproduced; no songs nor narratives of
noble deeds; no expectation of the last great battle
where the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>einherjar</i></span> were to accompany Allfather to
meet his gigantic antagonists; no flashing Shieldmays
animating the brave with their discourse, and
lightening the hall with their splendour: but chill
and ice, frost and darkness; shadowy realms without
a sun, without song or wine or feast, or the
soul-inspiring company of heroes, glorying in the
great deeds of their worldly life.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the perjurer and the secret murderer Nástrond
existed, a place of torment and punishment—the
strand of the dead—filled with foulness,
peopled with poisonous serpents, dark, cold, and
gloomy: the kingdom of Hel was <em>Hades</em>, the invisible,
the world of shadows<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c008'><sup>[725]</sup></a>: Nástrond was what
we call <em>Hell</em>. Christianity however admitted no
goddess of death, and when it was thought necessary
to express the idea of a place of punishment
after death, the Anglosaxon united the realm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Hel with Nástrond to complete a hideous prison
for the guilty: the prevailing idea in the infernal
regions of the Teuton is cold and gloom<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c008'><sup>[726]</sup></a>; the poisonous
snakes, which waking or sleeping seem ever
to have haunted the Anglosaxon, formed a convenient
point of junction between his own traditional
hell and that which he heard of from the pulpit,
in quotations from the works of the Fathers; and
to these and their influence alone can it be attributed
when we find flames and sulphur, and all the
hideous apparatus of Judaic tradition, adopted by
him. In this fact seems to me to lie a very important
mark of ancient heathendom, and one which the
clergy themselves admitted, a belief in which they
shared, and which they did not scruple to impress
upon their flocks, even in spite of the contrary tendency
of their authorities: it will be sufficient to
refer to the description given of hell in the poetic
Salomon and Saturn, a composition redolent of
heathendom: on the defeat of the rebel angels, it
is said, God</p>

<p class='c001'>Even in their more orthodox descriptions, ecclesiastical
poets, though naturally adopting the Judaic
notions, cannot always shake off the old, habitual
tradition of their forefathers, but recur to
the frost, gloom and serpents of Nástrond, and the
realm of Hel; of which a passage already quoted
from Beda is ample evidence.</p>

<p class='c001'>As far as we can judge from the descriptions
which survive, the Anglosaxons represented Hell to
themselves as a close and covered dwelling, a prison
duly secured as earthly prisons are by locks, bolts
and bars<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c008'><sup>[728]</sup></a>. But the popular fancy had probably
even then adopted the notion of a monstrous beast
whose <em>mouth</em> was the entrance to the place of torment:
this appears not only from the illustrations
to Cædmon<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c008'><sup>[729]</sup></a>, but from the common expression, so
long current, of Hell-mouth. From this peculiar
feature however we may believe that a remembrance
still lurked among our forefathers of the gigantic
or Titanic character of the ancient goddess, who, in
Norse mythology, was Loki’s daughter. In nearly
every case, the word Hel in Anglosaxon, and especially
Anglosaxon prose, has merely the abstract
sense we now give it; but here and there a passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>may be found in which we discover traces of the
personal meaning: thus perhaps in Beówulf where
we find these lines,</p>

<p class='c001'>However as a death in battle did not consign
the warrior to Hel, it is usually Hild or Wig who
is represented as ravishing away the doomed hero.
Hel was no desired object, to be introduced into
the epic as the portion of chieftains and kings.</p>

<p class='c021'>FATES.—The Northern creed, and, as it now
seems established, the German also, admitted the
intervention between man and the gods, of subordinate
deities or Fates. I call them subordinate from
their peculiar position in the fragmentary portions
of mythology that survive; in their nature we must
believe them to be of a higher order than the gods,
who themselves are doomed one day to perish, and
who can probably as little avoid their doom as men,
the frailer creatures of their power. It may be that
in this, different views prevailed among different
classes of men; the warlike princes and their followers,
who exulted in tales of battle and feasting,
may have been willing to see in Oþinn the supreme
disposer of events, while a deeper wisdom lurked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>in the sacerdotal songs that told how Urðr, Werðandi
and Skuld (the Norns of the Past, the Present
and the Future) bore inevitable sway over the
inhabitants of heaven and earth, and slowly waited
for the period which was to confound gods, man and
nature in one vast destruction<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c008'><sup>[731]</sup></a>. The Norse view
admits however of more than three Norns, though
it names those only who have been mentioned;
and from the extraordinary relation of those three,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>it can hardly be doubted that the others are of a
different order; moreover it attributes human passions
to them which are hardly consistent with the
functions of the venerable Fates; in this case it is
possible that the Valkyriur, a race of beings whose
functions might in some respects be confounded with
those of the Nornir, have been so mixed up with
them. Man, dealing with the daily affairs of troubled
life, thinks more of the past than of the future:
to him the present is the child of the past, the past
the excuse for or cause of all he does and suffers;
his intellect comprehends the events that are completed
or in course of completion, but not the indefinite,
illimitable probabilities of the undiscovered
<em>to be</em>; hence perhaps Urðr is considered the oldest
and most powerful of the Fates; her work is
done, the others are doing or yet to do. Through
this progress of opinion it became possible for the
conception of the older Fate to include and finally
supersede those of the others, as soon as the living
belief in their personal agency became weakened.
I do not know that any certain trace of these Fates
can be found in the High-german countries<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c008'><sup>[732]</sup></a>, but
in the Low-german the eldest Norn still survives
long after the introduction of Christianity, in a
sense little removed at times from that of Necessity
itself. That this should still have been coupled
with a lively feeling of personality only proves how
deeply rooted the old Heathen creed had been. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the following instances from the Oldsaxon Héljand<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c008'><sup>[733]</sup></a>,
Wurth might almost in every case be replaced by
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dód</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mors</i></span>: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Thiu Wurth is at handun, dód is at
hendi;</span>”—the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wierd</i></span><a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c008'><sup>[734]</sup></a>, or death, is at hand, i. e. so
near that she might lay hold of the doomed. “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Thiu
<em>Wurth</em> nahida thuo,</span>”—the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>weird</i></span> drew nigh. “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wurth</i></span>
ina benam,” <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wierd</i></span>, i. e. the goddess of death, ravished
him away; as in Anglosaxon we have <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Swylt
benam</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Deáð benam</span>, and similar expressions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Anglosaxon equivalent is <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><em>Wyrd</em></span>, an expression
of the very commonest and most frequent occurrence.
It should however be borne in mind that
there are two separate uses of this word, one a more
abstract one, in which it is capable of being used
in the plural, and which may generally be rendered
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>eventus</i></span><a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c008'><sup>[735]</sup></a>, another more personal, similar to the Oldsaxon

We have seen that <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wierd</i></span> opposes, that
she stands close to the doomed warrior, that she
ravishes him away, that she sweeps away the power
of men, that she decides or appoints the event,
that she is hard and cruel and pursues her victims.
But she also <em>weaves</em>, weaves the web of destiny, as
we can say even to this day without violence. It
is necessary to give examples of this expression:
“Me ðæt wyrd gewæf<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c008'><sup>[750]</sup></a>,”—<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wierd</i></span> wove that for
me; similar to which is, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ac him dryhten forgeaf
wígspéda gewiofu</span><a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c008'><sup>[751]</sup></a>,”—but the Lord gave him
the weft of victory; where undoubtedly an earlier
weaving Wyrd was thought of. “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðonne seó
þrag cymeð, wefen wyrd-stafum</span><a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c008'><sup>[752]</sup></a>,”—when the time
cometh, woven with <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>wierd</i></span>-staves, or letters, probably
<em>runes</em>. There is a remarkable passage in the
same collection<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c008'><sup>[753]</sup></a>, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wyrmas mec ne áwǽfon, Wyrda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>cræftum, ða ðe geolo godwebb geatwum frætwað,</span>”—Worms
wove me not, with the skill of <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wierds</i></span>,
those namely which the yellow silk for garments
beautifully form. Here weaving is especially put
forward as that in which <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Wierd</i></span> excels, her own
peculiar craft and business<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c008'><sup>[754]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spinning and weaving are the constant occupation
of Teutonic goddesses and heroines: Holda
and Bertha spin<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c008'><sup>[755]</sup></a>, and so do all the representatives
of these goddesses in popular tradition even down
to the fairies. But the Valkyriur or Shieldmays
also weave, and in this function, as well as their
immediate action in the battle-field, as choosers of
the slain<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c008'><sup>[756]</sup></a>, they have some points of contact with
the Norns and Wyrd<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c008'><sup>[757]</sup></a>. Gray has transferred to our
language from the Nials Saga a fine poem<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c008'><sup>[758]</sup></a> which
throws some light upon the weaving of the Valkyriur,
the wígspéda gewiofu. The Anglosaxon belief
in the Shieldmaidens comes to us indeed in a darkened
form, yet we can hardly doubt that it survived.
The word Wælcyrge occurs in glossaries to explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Bellona</i></span>, the goddess of war, and one gloss calls
eyes <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wælcyrigean</span>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gorgonei</i></span>, terrible as those of
Gorgo; the flashing of the eyes was very probably
one mark of a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wælcyrge</span> in the old belief<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c008'><sup>[759]</sup></a>, as she
floated or rode above the closing ranks of battle.
In the superstitions of a later period however we
find a clear allusion to these supernatural maidens.

<p class='c021'>“Sit, ye victorious women (or women of victory)

<p class='c021'>CREATION AND DESTRUCTION.—The cosmogony
of the Pentateuch was necessarily adopted
by the Saxon converts; yet not so entirely as to
exclude all the traditions of heathendom. In the
mythology of the Northern nations, the creation
of the world occupied an important place: its details
are recorded in some of the most striking lays
of the earlier Edda; and several of them appear
unconsciously to have acted upon the minds of our
Christian poets. The genius of the Anglosaxons
does not indeed seem to have led them to the
adoption of those energetic and truly imaginative
forms of thought which the Scandinavians probably
derived from the sterner natural features that
surrounded them: the rude rocks and lakes of
Norway and Sweden, the volcanoes, hot springs,
ice plains and snow-covered mountains of Iceland,
readily moulded the Northmen to a different train
of thought from that which satisfied the dwellers
in the marshlands of the Elbe and the fat plains of
Britain. But as in the main it cannot be doubted
that the heathendom of both races was the same,
so even in many modes of expression we meet with
a resemblance which can hardly be accidental.
Like almost every other people, the Northmen considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>a gigantic chaos to have preceded the world
of order. While the giant Ymer lived, the earth
was “without form and void.” Listen to the words
of the Vaulu Spá, or Prophetess’s Song:</p>

coincides with the old remains of heathendom:</p>

<p class='c001'>Then follows the creation of light, the separation
of evening and morning, and the production of
organic life, as in the first chapter of Genesis. The
Wída grund, or <em>vast abyss</em>, is the Ginnunga gap,
<em>yawning gulf</em>, of the Edda, and a very remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>parallel lies in the assertion that there was no <em>grass</em>
anywhere to make green the earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world was created out of the portions of
Ymer’s body; but it seems to be a remnant of ancient
heathendom when we find in later times a
tradition that Man was created out of the great
natural portions of the world itself. An ancient
Frisic manuscript quoted by Grimm in Haupt’s
Altdeutsche Blätter<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c008'><sup>[768]</sup></a> says, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">God scóp thene éresta
meneska, thet was Adam, fon achta wendem; thet
bénete fon tha sténe, thet flásk fon there erthe, thet
blód fon tha wetere, tha herta fon tha winde, thene
thochta fon tha wolken, thene suét fon tha dáwe,
tha lokkar fon tha gerse, tha ágene fon there sunna,
and tha blérem on thene helga óm.</span>” That is,—God
created him of eight things: his bones from stone,
his flesh from earth, his blood from water, his heart
from wind, his thought from cloud, his sweat from
dew, his hair from the grass, his eyes from the
sun, and then breathed into him the breath of life.
In the prose Salomon and Saturn we are also told
that Adam was created of eight pounds by weight:
a pound of earth from whence his flesh; a pound
of fire, whence his red and hot blood; a pound of
wind, whence his breathing; a pound of cloud,
whence his unsteadiness of mood; a pound of grace,
whence his stature and growth; a pound of blossoms,
whence the variety of his eyes; a pound of
dew, whence his sweat; and a pound of salt, whence
his salt tears<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c008'><sup>[769]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>But a much more striking proof of heathendom
lies in the Anglosaxon belief that after the destruction
of this creation a more beautiful one would
arise; not only a metaphysical kingdom of heaven,
but a concrete world like our own, on a more imposing
and glorious scale. It was the belief of the
Northmen that in the closing evening of the ages,
the Ragna-rauk, or twilight of the Gods, the old
Titanic powers would burst their fetters; Loki, the
Northern Satan, would be released from his bondage;
Midgard’s orm, the serpent that surrounds
the world, would rise in his giant fury; the wolf
Fenrir would snap his chain and move against the
gods; the ship Naglfar, made of the nails of the
dead, and steered by Loki, would convey the sons
of Muspelheim to Vigrid, the plain on which this
heathen Armageddon was to be fought: at their
head the terrible Surtr, the black, the destroyer of
the gods, beneath whose sword of fire the whole
world should perish.</p>

ages, it is impossible not to recognize in them traces
of that primæval faith which teaches the responsibility
of man, the rule of just and holy beings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>superior to himself, and a future existence of joy
and sorrow, the ultimate consequence of human
actions. With what amount of distinctness this
great truth may have been placed before their eyes,
we cannot tell, but it is enough that we see it admitted
in one of the most thoroughly heathen poems
of the Edda, and confirmed by an Anglosaxon tradition
totally independent of Christianity. Weak as
it is while unsupported by the doctrine of a gracious
Redeemer, it is not wholly inoperative upon the
moral being of men; and its reception among the
nations of the North must have tended to prepare
them for the doctrine which in the fulness of time
was to supersede their vague and powerless desires
by the revelation of the crucified Saviour.</p>

<p class='c021'>HEROES.—It now remains that we should bestow
a few words upon the heroic names which
figure in the Epopœa of the North, and which probably
in many cases belong to the legends and the
worship of gods now forgotten, or which at least
represent those gods in their heroic form and character;
even as the Iliad in Achilles may celebrate
only one form of the Dorian Apollo, and the legends
of Cadmus and Theseus may be echoes from
an earlier cult of Jupiter and Neptune.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hero Scyld or Sceldwa<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c008'><sup>[779]</sup></a> has been mentioned
as the godlike progenitor of the Scyldingas, the
royal race of Denmark; but he also appears among
the mythical ancestors of Wóden, in the genealogy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>of Wessex. It is a singular fact that the Anglosaxons
alone possess the fine mythus of this hero;
the opening division or canto of Beówulf relates of
him that he was exposed as a child in a ship upon
the ocean; a costly treasure accompanied the sleeping
infant as he floated to the shores of the Gardanes,
whose king he became; after reigning gloriously
and founding a race of kings, he died, and
was again sent forth in his ship, surrounded with
treasures, to go into the unknown world, from
which he came; he came to found a royal race<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c008'><sup>[780]</sup></a>,
and having done so, he departs and nothing more
is known of him. That this mythus was deeply
felt in England appears from its being referred
to even by the later chroniclers: Æðelweard<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c008'><sup>[781]</sup></a> and
William of Malmesbury<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c008'><sup>[782]</sup></a> mention it at length, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>desire to engraft a national upon a biblical tradition
not only causes Sceaf to be called by some authors the
son of Shem, but leads to the assertion of the Saxon
chronicle that Sceaf was the son of Noah, born in
the ark<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c008'><sup>[783]</sup></a>, in obvious allusion to the miraculous exposure
on the waters. The mention of Scani by
Æðelweard may be taken in connection with a
Norse tradition that Skjold was Skanunga goþ, a
god of the Scanings. An Anglosaxon riddle in the
Codex Exoniensis<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c008'><sup>[784]</sup></a>, and of which the answer seems
to me to be only <em>a shield</em>, concludes with the very
remarkable words,</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='50%' />
<col width='50%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">nama mín is mǽre,<br /> hæleðum gifre,<br /> and hálig sylf.</span></td>
    <td class='c019'>mighty is my name,<br /> rapacious among men,<br /> and itself holy.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c001'>The second line seems to exclude the supposition of
there being any reference to Almighty God, though
Scyld, like Helm, is one of his names, examples
of which are numerous in all Anglosaxon poetry.
There are one or two places in England which bear
the name of this god or hero: these are <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scyldes
treów</span><a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c008'><sup>[785]</sup></a>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scyldmere</span><a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c008'><sup>[786]</sup></a>, and <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Scyldes heáfda</span><a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c008'><sup>[787]</sup></a>; but except
in the genealogy of Wessex and the tradition
recorded by Æðelweard and William of Malmesbury,
there is no record of Sceaf.</p>

<p class='c001'>As in the poem of Beówulf, Scyld is said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>a son called Beówulf from whom the kings of Sleswig
are descended, so in the genealogy of Wessex,
Scyld is followed by Beaw: there is some uncertainty
in the form of the name, but upon comparison
of all the different versions given by various
chroniclers, we may conclude that it was Beówa or
Beów, a word equivalent to Beówulf. The original
divinity of this person is admitted by Grimm, but
he suffers himself to be misled by some over-skilful
German lexicographer who has added <em>Beewolf</em> to
the list of English names for the woodpecker, and
would render Beówulf as a sort of Latin Picus.
I am not aware that any bird in England was ever
called the <em>beewolf</em>, or that there are any superstitions
connected with the woodpecker in England,
as there are in Germany; the cuckoo and the
magpie are our birds of augury. When Grimm
then declares himself disposed not to give up the
termination -<em>wulf</em> in the name, he has only the
authority of the poem on his side, in defence of his
theory: against which must be placed every other
list or genealogy; and it seems to me that these
are strongly confirmed by the occurrence of a place
called, not Beówulfes hám, but Beówan hám<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c008'><sup>[788]</sup></a>, in
immediate connection with another named Grendles
mere<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c008'><sup>[789]</sup></a>: Whatever the name, this hero was looked
upon as the eponymus of various royal races, and
this, though the names which have survived are
obviously erroneous<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c008'><sup>[790]</sup></a>, is distinctive of his real character.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>There are various other heroes mentioned in the
poem of Beówulf and in the Traveller’s Song, some
remembrance of which is still preserved in local
names in various parts of England. A few words
may not be misplaced respecting them. In the
first-named poem, the hero’s lord and suzerain is
invariably named Hygelác; after whose death Beówulf
himself becomes king of the Geátas. As Hygelác
is said to have perished in fight against the
Franks, and as history records the fall of a Danish
king Chochilachus in a predatory excursion into
the Frankish territory about the beginning of the
seventh century<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c008'><sup>[791]</sup></a>, Outzen, Leo and others have
identified the two in fact as well as name, and
drawn conclusions as to the mythical hero, from
the historical prince. The coincidence is not conclusive:
if Hygelác’s name were already mythical
in the seventh century, it may easily have been given
to any leader who ventured a plundering expedition
into the Frankish territory, especially as the warlike
records of an earlier Hygelác would be certain
to contain some account of Frankish forays: nor
was Hygelác, in Danish Hugleikr<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c008'><sup>[792]</sup></a>, by any means
an uncommon name. On the other hand, if we
admit the historical allusion, we must assign a date
to, at any rate, that episode of the poem which is
hardly consistent with its general character. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>therefore inclined to think that in this instance, as
in so many others, an accidental resemblance has
been too much relied upon: it is in fact quite as
likely (or even more likely) that the historian should
have been indebted to the legend, than that the
poet should have derived his matter from history.
It does seem probable that Hygelác enjoyed a mythical
character among the Germans: in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altdeutsche
Blätter</span>” of Moriz Haupt<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c008'><sup>[793]</sup></a>, we find the following
statement, taken from a MS. of the tenth
century. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Getarum rege Huiglauco mirae
magnitudinis.—Et sunt mirae magnitudinis, ut rex
Huiglaucus, qui imperavit Getis et a Francis occisus
est, quem equus a duodecimo anno portare
non potuit, cuius ossa in Rheni fluminis insula, ubi
in oceanum prorumpit, reservata sunt et de longinquo
venientibus pro miraculo ostenduntur.</span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Hygelác is not known in Germany only:
even in England we have traces of him in local
names: thus Hygeláces geát<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c008'><sup>[794]</sup></a>, which, as the name
was never borne by an Anglosaxon,—so far at
least as we know,—speaks strongly for his mythical
character. That the fortunes, under similar
circumstances, of a historical prince, of the same
name or not of the same name, should have become
mixed up with an earlier legend, is by no means
unusual or surprising.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another hero of the Beówulf cycle is Hnæf the
Hócing, whose fate is described in a fine episode<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c008'><sup>[795]</sup></a>,
and is connected with the poem called “The battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>of Finnesburh<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c008'><sup>[796]</sup></a>.” Of him too England has something
to tell: I find a place was called <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hnæfes scylf</span><a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c008'><sup>[797]</sup></a>,
and further that there was a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hóces byrgels</span><a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c008'><sup>[798]</sup></a>, obviously
not a Christian burial-place, a <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hóces ham</span><a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c008'><sup>[799]</sup></a>, and a
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Hócing mǽd</span><a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c008'><sup>[800]</sup></a>. But unless resemblances greatly
deceive us, we must admit that this hero was not
entirely unknown to the Franks also; Charlemagne’s
wife Hiltikart, a lady of most noble
blood among the Swæfas or Sueves (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nobilissimi
generis Suavorum puella</span>”) was a near relation of
Kotofrit, duke of the Alamanni<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c008'><sup>[801]</sup></a>: in her genealogy
occur the names Huocingus and Nebi in immediate
succession, and it seems difficult not to see in
these Hócing and Hnæf. If, as has been suggested,
the Hócings were Chauci or Frisians, their connexion
with the Sueves must be of an antiquity
almost transcending the limits of history, and
date from those periods when the Frisians were
neighbours of the Swæfas upon the Elbe, and long
before these occupied the highlands of Germany,
long in fact before the appearance of the Franks in
Gaul, under Chlodio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the heroes of heathen tradition are Wada,
Weland and Eigil. All three, so celebrated in the
mythus and epos of Scandinavia and Germany, have
left traces in England. Of Wada the Traveller’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Song declares that he ruled the Helsings<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c008'><sup>[802]</sup></a>; and even
later times had to tell of Wade’s <em>boat</em><a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c008'><sup>[803]</sup></a>, in which
the exact allusion is unknown to us: the Scandinavian
story makes him wade across the Groenasund,
carrying his son upon his shoulder; perhaps
our tradition gave a different version of this perilous
journey. The names of places which record his
name are not numerous, but still such are found,
thus <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wadanbeorgas</span><a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c008'><sup>[804]</sup></a>, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Wadanhlǽw</span><a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c008'><sup>[805]</sup></a>. It is otherwise,
however, with his still more celebrated son,
Weland, the Wieland of German, Völundr of Norse
and Galand of French tradition. Weland is the
most famous of smiths, and all good swords are his
work. In Beówulf, the hero when about to engage
in a perilous adventure, requests that if he falls his
coat-of-mail may be sent home, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Welandes geweorc</i></span>,
either literally the work of Weland, or a work so admirable
that Weland might have made it.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c008'><sup>[806]</sup></a> Ælfred
in his Boetius<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c008'><sup>[807]</sup></a> translates <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>fidelis ossa Fabricii</i></span> by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>“ðæs wísan goldsmiðes bán Welondes,” where, as
Grimm<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c008'><sup>[808]</sup></a> observes, the word Fabricius (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>faber</i></span>) may
have led him to think of the most celebrated of
smiths, Weland. The use made by Sir W. Scott of
Weland’s name must be familiar to all readers of
Kenilworth: from what has been said it will appear
how mistaken in many respects his view was.
The place in Berkshire which even yet in popular
tradition preserves the name of <em>Wayland smith</em>, is
nevertheless erroneously called; the boundary of a
Saxon charter names it much more accurately
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Welandes smiððe</span>, i. e. <em>Weland’s smithy</em>, his workshop<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c008'><sup>[809]</sup></a>.
The legend of Weland, identical in many
respects with that of the Wilkina Saga and other
Northern versions, is mentioned in the Cod. Exon.
p. 377. Here we find notice taken of his mutilation
by Niðaudr, the violence done by him to Bödhildr,
and other acts of his revenge<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c008'><sup>[810]</sup></a>, all in fact that
is most important in this part of his history. Grimm
reminds me<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c008'><sup>[811]</sup></a> that the Wilkina Saga makes Weland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the constructor of a wondrous boat, and that the
act of the son may thus have been transferred to
the father, Weland’s boat to Wade.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Northern tradition appears a brother of
Weland, named Eigil or Egil, who is celebrated as
an archer, and to whom belongs the wide-spread
tale which has almost past into accredited history
in the case of William Tell; this tale given by Saxo
Grammaticus to Toko, by the Jomsvíkínga Saga
to Palnatoki, and by other authorities to other
heroes from the twelfth till the very end of the fifteenth
century, but most likely of the very highest
antiquity in every part of Europe, was beyond
doubt an English one also, and is repeated in the
ballad of William of Cloudesley: it is therefore probable
that it belongs to a much older cycle, and
was as well known as the legends of Wada and
Weland, with which it is so nearly connected. Eigil
would among the Anglosaxons have borne the
form of Ægel, and accordingly we find places
compounded with this name,—thus Æglesbyrig,
now Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire; Æglesford,
now Aylsford in Kent; Ægleslona, in Worcester<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c008'><sup>[812]</sup></a>;
Ægleswurð, now Aylsworth in Northamptonshire<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c008'><sup>[813]</sup></a>;
also Ægleswyl; and lastly Aylestone in Leicestershire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Wilkina Saga and the Scald’s Complaint
already cited from the Codex Exoniensis, lead us
next to the legends of Ðeódríc (Dietrich von Bern)
and Eormenríc, (Hermanaríc), and through the latter
to Sigfried and the other heroes of the Nibelungen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>cycle. The heroic or even godlike character
of Dietrich has been well made out by Grimm<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c008'><sup>[814]</sup></a>, and
the historical Theodoric the Ostrogoth vanishes in
his traditional representative. The Anglosaxon
poet evidently refers to the latter, not indeed from
the story he tells, but from the collocation of Ðeódríc
among merely mythical personages. Perhaps,
as the whole scope of his poem is to relate the misfortunes
of the great and thus draw consolation for
his own, the thirty years’ residence in Mæringaburg
may be considered as a reference to Ðeódríc’s
flight from before Otachar<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c008'><sup>[815]</sup></a> and long-continued
exile. In a Saxon menology<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c008'><sup>[816]</sup></a> of great antiquity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>the author, after stating the eighteenth of May to
be the commemoration of St. John, Pope and Martyr,
goes on to say, that an anchoret on Lipari told
certain sailors how at a particular time he had seen
king Theodoric, ungirt, barefoot, and bound, led
between St. John and St. Finian, and by them
hurled into the boiling crater of the neighbouring
island Vulcano. That on their return to Italy the
sailors discovered by comparison of dates that
Theodoric died on the day on which the anchoret
noticed his punishment by the hands of his victims.
The author expressly tells it was Theodoricus,
the king of the Goths in Ravenna; and he
concludes by saying, “That was Theodoricus the
king whom we call Ðeódríc,” which we can only understand
by supposing him to allude to the mythical
Ðeódríc. Ælfred seems also to have known something
of the mythical Ðeódríc when he says, “he
wæs Amaling,” a fact historically true of the Ostrogoth
Theodoric, but yet unlikely to have been contained
in Ælfred’s Latin authorities. The Traveller’s
Song says<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c008'><sup>[817]</sup></a>, “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ðeódríc weóld Froncum,</span>” Theodoric
ruled the Franks, but this I should rather
understand of one of the historical Merwingian
kings, than of the Ostrogoth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The legends of Eormanríc were obviously familiar
to the Anglosaxons: in the so often quoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>poem of the Traveller’s Song, this celebrated prince
is mentioned more than once, as well as in the
poem which contains the notices of Weland, Beadohild
and Ðeódríc. The character given of him in
both these compositions denotes a familiarity with
the details of his history, as we find them almost
universally in the Northern traditions, and more
particularly those of his wealth, his cruelty and his
treachery.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Beówulf we have a somewhat further development
of his history. We there learn incidentally that
Háma (the Ammius of Saxo Grammaticus) carried
off from him the Brósinga-mén or mythical collar
of the goddess Freya. There can be no doubt that
this necklace, called in the Norse traditions Mén
Brísínga, is of a most thoroughly mythological <a id='corr425.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='chaacter'>character</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_425.16'><ins class='correction' title='chaacter'>character</ins></a></span><a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c008'><sup>[818]</sup></a>,
and any reference to it in Saxon poetry is
welcome evidence of ancient heathendom: moreover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>the Anglosaxon poet alone mentions it in connection
with Eormanríc. This peculiar feature is
as little known to the other Germanic nations as
the beautiful legend of Scyld Scéfing, the loves of
Geát and Mǽðhild, the dragon-slaughter of Sigmund,
the wars of Hengest and Finn Folcwalding,
or the noble epos of Beówulf itself: unfortunately
we have no detail as to the circumstances under
which the necklace of the goddess came into the
possession of Eormanríc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Traveller’s Song however has traces of many
heroes who are closely connected with the traditional
cyclus of Eormanríc: among these are Sifeca
(the false Sibich of Germany) and Becca, the Bikki
of the corresponding Norse versions, whom it
makes chieftain of the Baningas, perhaps the “sons
of mischief” from <em>Bana</em>. Háma, already named,
and Wudga, the Wittich and Heime of Germany,
occur in the same poem: so also the terrible Ætla,
Attila the Hun, the Ætli of Scandinavia, the Etzel
of the Nibelungen cycle. In the same composition
we find Gúðhere, king of the Burgundians, the
Norse Gunnar, and German Gunther; and Hagena,
probably the Norse Högni, and Hagen the murderer
of Sigfried. The Traveller’s Song, and the
Scóp’s Complaint contain no mention of the great
hero of the Norse and German epos, Sigurdr Fafnisbani,
Sigfried, the betrothed of the Shieldmay Bryhyldur,
the husband of the fairhaired Chriemhilt.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the more welcome to us is the episode in
Beówulf, which not only records the tale of Sigurdr,
though under the name of his father Sigmund, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>makes particular mention of the dragon-slaughter
(Fafnis-bani)—which is a central point in the Norse
tradition, although hardly noticed at all in the Nibelungen
Lied,—but also refers to the fearful adventures
which the Edda relates of the hero and
his kinsman Sinfiötli (Fitela) which appear totally
unknown in Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having said thus much of the heroic personages
to whom so large a portion of Northern and Germanic
tradition is devoted, it becomes possible for
me to refer to the great work of James Grimm on
German mythology for a demonstration of the connection
between these heroes and the gods of our
forefathers. I regret that my own limits render it
impossible for me to enter at greater length upon
this part of the subject; but it requires a work of
no small dimensions, and devoted to it exclusively:
and it is therefore sufficient to show the identity
of our own heroic story and that of Scandinavia and
the continent, and thus enable the English reader
to adapt to his own national traditions the conclusions
of learned enquirers abroad, with respect to
their own<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c008'><sup>[819]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>DIVINATION AND WITCHCRAFT.—The
attachment of the Germanic races to divination
attracted the notice of Tacitus<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c008'><sup>[820]</sup></a>: he says: “They
are as great observers of auspices and lots as any.
The way they use their lots is simple; they cut
into slips a branch taken from an oak or beech,
and having distinguished them by certain marks,
scatter them at random and as chance wills over a
white cloth. Then if the enquiry is a public one,
the state-priest,—if a private one, the father of the
house himself,—having prayed to the gods, and
looking up to heaven, thrice raises each piece, and
interprets them when raised according to the marks
before inscribed upon them. If they turn out unfavourable,
there is no further consultation that
day about the same matter: if they are favourable,
the authority of omens is still required. Even here
they are acquainted with a mode of interrogating
the voices and flight of birds; but it is peculiar to
this race to try the presages and admonitions of
horses. These, white in colour and subject to no
mortal work, are fed at the public cost in the sacred
groves and woods: then being harnessed to the
sacred chariot, they are accompanied by the priest,
the king or the prince of the state, who observe
their neighings and snortings. Nor has any augury
more authority than this, not only among the
common people, but even the nobles and priests:
for they think themselves the ministers, but the
horses the confidants, of the gods. There is another
customary form of auspices, by which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>inquire concerning the event of serious wars. They
match a captive of the nation with which they are
at war, however they can come by him, with a select
champion of their own, each armed with his
native weapons. The victory of this one or that
is taken as a presage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The use of lots as connected with heathendom,
that is, as a means of looking into futurity, continued
in vogue among the Saxons till a late period,
in spite of the efforts of the clergy: this is evident
from the many allusions in the Poenitentials, and
the prohibitions of the secular law. The augury by
horses does not appear to have been used in England,
from any allusion at least which still survives;
but it was still current in Germany in the seventh
century, and with less change of adjuncts than we
usually find in the adoption of heathen forms by
Christian saints. It was left to the decision of horses
to determine where the mortal remains of St. Gall
should rest; the saint would not move, till certain
unbroken horses were brought and charged with his
coffin: then, after prayers, we are told, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elevato
igitur a pontifice nec non et a sacerdote feretro, et
equis superposito, ait episcopus: ‘Tollite frena de
capitibus eorum, et pergant, ubi Dominus <a id='corr429.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='voluerit”'>voluerit.’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_429.25'><ins class='correction' title='voluerit”'>voluerit.’</ins></a></span>

et psallentes, equis praecedentibus, via incipiebatur</span><a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c008'><sup>[821]</sup></a>.”
It may be imagined that the horses infallibly
found the proper place for the saint’s burial-place;
but what is of importance to us is the use
of horses on the occasion. In this country however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>we have some record of a divination in which
not horses but a bull played a principal part; and
as bulls were animals sacred to the great goddess
Nerthus, it is not unlikely that this was a remnant
of ancient heathendom. St. Benedict on one occasion
appeared to a fisherman named Wulfgeat,
and desired him to announce to duke Æðelwine<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c008'><sup>[822]</sup></a>,
his lord, that it was his the saint’s wish to have a
monastery erected to himself, to the pious mother
of mercy and All virgins. The spot was to be where
he should see a bull stamp with his foot. To use
the words of the saint to the fisherman, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut ei
igitur haec omnia per ordinem innotescas exhortor,
sermonem addens sermoni, quatenus scrutetur diligentius
in loco praedicto quomodo noctu fessa
terrae sua incumbant animalia, <em>ac ubi taurum surgentem
pede dextro viderit percutere terram</em>, ibidem
proculdubio xenodochii sciat se aram erigere debere.</span>”
Obedient to the order, duke Æðelwine set
out in the morning to find the spot: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mira res, et
miranda, ubi vir praedictus insulam est ingressus,
... <em>animalia sua in modum crucis, taurum vero
in medio eorum iacere prospexit</em>. Et sicut quondam
sancto Clementi agnus pede dextro locum fontis,
sic viro isti taurus terram pede percutiendo locum
mensae futuri arcisterii significavit divinitus</span><a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c008'><sup>[823]</sup></a>.” St.
Clement’s fountain never rolled such floods of gold
as found their way to the rich abbey of Ramsey!</p>

<p class='c001'>Other details of heathendom in the practices of

The former of these is mentioned in the poem of

<p class='c001'><em>Invultuation</em> is defined by Mr. Thorpe in the following
words: “a species of witchcraft, the perpetrators
of which were called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vultivoli</i></span>, and are thus
described by John of Salisbury: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui ad affectus hominum
immutandos, in molliori materia, cera forte
vel limo, eorum quos pervertere nituntur effigies
exprimunt</span><a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c008'><sup>[825]</sup></a>. To this superstition Virgil alludes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Limus ut hic durescit, et haec ut cera liquescit,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Of the practice of this superstition, both in
England and Scotland, many instances are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>met with; among the most remarkable, that of Eleanor
Cobham, duchess of Gloucester, and Stacey,
servant to George Duke of Clarence<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c008'><sup>[826]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But it seems to include also the practising against
the life of an enemy by means of a waxen or other
figure, in which pins were stuck, or against which
a sharp bolt was <a id='corr432.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='shot,'>shot.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_432.7'><ins class='correction' title='shot,'>shot.</ins></a></span> It is against this crime that
the law of Henry the First enacts<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c008'><sup>[827]</sup></a>: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis veneno,

alii, nihil refert, quin factum mortiferum, et nullo

intended by the word <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>liblác</i></span> used by Æðelstân<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c008'><sup>[828]</sup></a>. It
is also probable that this was the crime for which
in the tenth century a widow was put to death by
drowning at London Bridge, and her property forfeited
to the crown<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c008'><sup>[829]</sup></a>. Anglosaxon homilies however
also mention philtres of various kinds, which the
people are warned against as dangerous and damnable
heathendom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such are the fragments of a system which at one
time fed the religious yearnings and propped the
moral faith of our forefathers,—faint notes from a
chorus of triumphant jubilation which once rose to
heaven from every corner of the island.</p>

<p class='c001'>How shall we characterize it?  As a dull and debasing
<em>Fetish-worship</em>, worthy of African savages?
or as a vague and colourless <em>Pantheism</em>, in which
religion vanishes away, and philosophy gropes for
a basis which it cannot find? I think not.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Contemplate the child who bounds through the
wood, or pauses in delight upon the meadow, where
he wantons in the very joy of life itself: to him
this great creation is full of playmates, beings animate
or inanimate, with whom he shares his little
pleasures, to whom he can confide his little sorrows.
He understands their language, and in turn he has
a language for them, which he thinks they understand:
he knows more of their peculiarities than
the halting step of scientific observation is always
able to overtake; for he knows what science
haughtily refuses to contemplate or, it may be, is
unable to appreciate. The birds speak to him, the
forests whisper to him, the shadows and the low
tones of the hill and valley lull him to repose, the
winds wanton with his curled locks and blow them
over his shoulders, the streams and brooks have
spray to play with and sprinkle in his laughing
eyes. He stands before the great spirit of nature,
face to face, and knows him as he reveals himself
in every one of his divine forms; for the child sees
and knows the secrets of God, which the man, alas!
is condemned to forget. Such as the child is, has
the child-like nation been, before the busy hum
of commerce, the crashing strokes of the piston, the
heavy murmur of innumerable spinning-jennies
necessarily banished more natural music from our
ears. An age that thinks about itself and its own
capacity, that reflects upon its own processes of
thought, and makes great combinations of powers,
and anatomizes nature till it becomes familiar with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>every secret of creation, may be an earnest puritanical
age, a stern protestant age, one that will
not be fed with imaginative religions, but it cannot
be one of implicit, trusting, fearing, rejoicing, trembling
belief: the age of faith ceased where the age
of knowledge began. Man knows too much, perhaps
believes too little: he will not, and he must
not, yield his privilege of calm, determined, obstinate
enquiry: he will, and should, judge for himself,
weigh evidence, compare and reason, and decide
for himself how much or how little he will
receive as true. How can he wonder at the stars,
their rising, their setting or their eclipse? He calculates
where new planets may be found: he weighs
them in his balances when found, and tells not only
their circumference or their density, but how long
the straggling ray of light that started from them
was on its journey, before it reached the eye of the
gazer. What can these wavering fragments of time
and space be to him who calculates duration by the
nutation of suns, or the scarcely appreciable difference
of millennial changes? Let us remember what
our fathers were, and consider what we are. For
them there was indeed a time, a period to tell of,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>“when the Sun</div>
      <div class='line'>Knew not her dwelling, nor the Moon his power,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Stars knew not where their place should be!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>We know their places, and their dwellings, and
their power. They are subordinated to a hypothesis
of gravitation. For us there is no wavering
bridge of the Gods, no <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Bifröst</i></span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Asbrú</i></span>; our rainbow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>is a shadowy thing, a belt of deceptive colours,
the reflection of a sunbeam in the multitudinous
prisms of a shower-cloud. We have no <em>Hammer</em>,
wielded by the Thunder-god, and dreaded by the
giants; our <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>Miölner</i></span> has vanished into the indifference
of opposing electricities. Apothecaries’ Hall
prepares its simples without the aid of charms, or
invocation of divinities; and though we stand as yet
but on the threshold of science, we have closed for
ever behind us the portals of mystery and belief. For
we are raised upon the shoulders of the times gone
by, and cast a calm and easy view over the country
which our forefathers wandered through in fear
and trembling. We fear not what they feared; we
cling not to what they clung to, for relief and comfort;
we have set up our own idol, the <em>Understanding</em>,
fortified by laborious experience, taught by repeated
struggles and victories, firmly based on conquered,
catalogued and inventoried nature, on facts, the
stern children of a passionless reality. I know not
whether we have gained or lost in this inevitable
career of humanity; I have faith only that He who
rules the purpose of the ages, has thus cast our lot
in the infinite love and wisdom of his own thought.
But not to us, or in our finite forms of thought,
can the world be as once it was, and the “dull catalogue
of common things” admits no admixture of
a fancied divinity; nay, so far are we from seeking
to instil spirit into matter, that the informing soul
itself ceases to be the object of our contemplation,
while we are busied with the nerves and tendons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>or charmed with the wonderful combination of details
that form the perfect whole. We stand supreme
among the subjects of our knowledge; and
the marvels of science itself will now not form the
stock in trade of a second-class conjuror. Observe
the man who threads his way with imperturbable
security and speed through the thoroughfares of
a densely-peopled metropolis: the crowd throng
about him, yet he yields here, he advances there,
till at length, almost unconsciously, he has attained
the goal of his desire. He is familiar with the
straight lines and angles that surround him, he
measures his position and stands upright, mistaking,
if indeed he think at all, the inconceivably
rapid calculations of the understanding for acts of
his own spontaneous volition. The unaccustomed
eye of the child cannot do this; and he wavers in
his steps and stumbles from point to point, helpless,
but charming in his helplessness, till practice
brings him power, and he too walks and stands
upright among men. So is it with the minds of
men in early and uninstructed periods, stumbling
from belief to belief, resting for support upon every
circumstance of surrounding life, and unfurnished
with the elements of scientific reasoning, which, by
assuring certainty, destroy the vague, indefinite
basis of faith, or bring within a narrow and constantly
decreasing circle, its vague and indefinite
object. We believe the results of Geometry, the
theorems of analytic mathematics, because we cannot
help ourselves, cannot escape from the inevitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>conclusion involved in the premises; but we
cannot call this acquiescence faith, or establish
upon it a moral claim before our own conscience
and our God. And as there can be no reason save
in the unintelligible, no faith save in the impossible,
all that is brought within the realm of the intellect,
or the sphere of the possible, is just so much
withdrawn from the circle of religion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The basis of the religious state in man is the
sensation of weakness,—whether that weakness be
or be not distinctly traced in the consciousness to
the ignorance which is its cause, or to the ultimate,
more abstract and more philosophical conviction of
sinfulness, in the conscience. Man cannot rest for
his anxious desire to know the why and how of
every phænomenon he observes: this restlessness is
the law of his intellect, that is, the condition of his
humanity: he interrogates the phænomena themselves,
but if they will give no answer to his question,
he will seek it without them. In himself he
will seek it in vain. At no time, at no stage of his
development can he understand the relation of the
subject and the object, or comprehend the copula
that unites them. The philosopher the most deeply
trained in watching abstract forms of thought, acknowledges
with a sigh that even the intuitions of
the reason halt in the fetters of the understanding,
and that to give objective reality to what can be
known only in the forms and through the powers
of the subjective, is at best to be guilty of a noble
treason to the laws of pure reasoning. And what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>shall he do, who is not trained in watching abstract
forms of thought? Is he more likely to find the
answer in himself? Alas, no! he feels only too
surely that his nature can give no satisfying response;
that his confined and bounded being is
itself full of problems which remain unsolved.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now let this state be considered with reference
to the early inhabitant of a world, whose secrets
are yet undiscovered, and on whom no light of heavenly
radiance has fallen. For him, as for us, there
is no answer either in the phænomenon or in the
observer: but he has no reason to reject the supposition
of a supernatural influence: everything
that surrounds him is filled with evidence of supernatural
power. He lives in nearer communion than
we do with the world about him: his frame, not
yet clogged and vitiated by the habits of an advanced
cultivation, is more alive than ours to the
external effects of natural causes: the world itself,
existing under different conditions of climate, different
electrical combinations, not yet subdued by
the plough, or the axe of the forester, not yet
bridled and trained by the canal, the manufactory
or the railroad, has effluences which act upon the
nerves and fluids of the man, and which seem to
him divine emanations, revelations of the divinity
within the lake, the mountain and the tree: the
lake, the mountain and the tree he peoples then
with gods,—with Nymphs and Nereids, with Oreads
and Hamadryads—to whose inward and spiritual
action the outward owes its power and its form.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>But the outward and visible is not a sign only, of
the inward and spiritual; it is a symbol, a part
of that which it denotes; it is at once the sower and
the seed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no age can man be without the great ideas of
God, of right, of power, of love, of wisdom; but an
age that has not learnt to feed upon abstractions,
must find the realization of those ideas in the outward
world, and in a few familiar facts of human
nature. It strives to give itself an account of itself,
and the result of its efforts is a paganism, always
earnest and imaginative, often cruel and capricious,
as often gentle, affectionate and trusting—for even
in spite of cruelty and caprice, the affections will
have their way, and trust will find a home. Its inconsistence
is the offspring not of guilt, but of imperfect
knowledge: it seeks the great solution of
all religious problems, a mediator between God and
man: it is its error, but not necessarily its crime,
that it finds that mediator in the complex of the
world itself: no other has been revealed to it; and
the reveries of philosophy that haunt the sounding
Portico or the flowery swathes of Hymettus, cannot
tell of the “Unknown God” to the agriculturist,
the huntsman or the pirate.</p>

<p class='c001'>I believe in two religions for my forefathers: one
that deals with the domestic life, and normal state
of peace; that sanctifies the family duties, prescribes
the relations of father, wife and child, divides
the land, and presides over its boundaries;
that tells of gods, the givers of fertility and increase,
the protectors of the husbandman and the herdsman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>that guards the ritual and preserves the liturgy;
that pervades the social state and gives permanence
to the natural, original political institutions.
I call this the sacerdotal faith, and I will
admit that to its teachers and professors we may
owe the frequent attempt of later periods to give an
abstract, philosophic meaning to mythus and tradition,
and to make dawning science halt after religion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second creed I will call the heroic; in this
I recognize the same gods, transformed into powers
of war and victory, crowners of the brave in fight,
coercers of the wild might of nature, conquerors of
the giants, the fiends and dragons; founders of
royal families, around whom cluster warlike comrades,
exulting in the thought that their deities
stand in immediate genealogical relation to themselves,
and share in the pursuits and occupations
which furnish themselves with wealth and dignity
and power. Let it be admitted that a complete
separation never takes place between these different
forms of religion; that a wavering is perceptible
from one to the other; that the warrior believes
his warrior god will bless the produce of his pastures;
that the cultivator rejoices in the heroic
legend of Wóden and of Baldr, because the cultivator
is himself a warrior, when the occasion demands
his services: still, in the ultimate development
and result of the systems, the original distinction
may be traced, and to it some of the conclusions
we observe must necessarily be referred: it
is thus that spells of healing and fruitfulness survive
when the great gods have vanished, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>the earth, the hills, the trees and waters retain a
portion of dimmed and bated divinity long after
the godlike has sunk into the heroic legend, or
been lost for ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>I can readily believe that the warrior and the
noble were less deeply impressed with the religious
idea than the simple cultivator. In the first place,
the disturbed life and active habits of military adventurers
are not favourable to the growth of religious
convictions: again, there is no tie more
potent than that which links sacred associations to
particular localities, and acts, unconsciously perhaps
but pervasively, upon all the dwellers near the
holy spots: the tribe may wander with all its wealth
of thought and feeling; even its gods may accompany
it to a new settlement; but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>religio loci</i></span>,
the indefinable influence of the local association,
cannot be transported. Habits of self-reliance, of
a proud and scornful independence, are not consistent
with the conviction of weakness, which is
necessary to our full admission of the divine pre-eminence;
and the self-confident soldier often felt
that he could cope with gods such as his had been
described to be. In the Greek heroic lay Tydides
could attack, defeat, and even wound Ares: I do
not know that the Teutonic mythology ever went
so far as this; but we have abundant record of
a contemptuous disregard with which particular
heroes of tradition treated the popular religion.
Some selected indeed one god in whom they placed
especial trust, and whom they worshipped (as far
as they worshipped at all) to the exclusion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>rest; but more must have participated in that feeling
which is expressed in a Danish song,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I trust my sword, I trust my steed,</div>
      <div class='line'>But most I trust myself at need<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c008'><sup>[830]</sup></a>!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>while to many we may safely apply what is said of a
Swedish prince, “<span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">han var mikit blandinn i trunni,</span>”
he was mightily confused in his belief. Still it is
certain that a personal character was attributed to
the gods, as well as an immediate intervention in
the affairs of life. The actual presence of Oþinn
from time to time on the battle-field, in the storm,
in the domestic privacy of the household, was firmly
believed, in Scandinavia; and it is reasonable to
assume that Wóden would have been found as active
among our German progenitors, had not the
earlier introduction of Christianity into Teutonic
Europe deprived us of the mythological records
which the North supplies. Beda tells us that
Eádwini of Northumberland sacrificed and offered
thanks to his gods upon the birth of a daughter.
Rǽdwald of Eastanglia, even after his nominal conversion,
continued to pay his offerings to idols,
and the people of Essex, when labouring under the
ravages of a pestilence, abjured the faith of Christ
and returned to the service of the ancient gods.
But in the personality of God alone resides the
possibility of realizing the religious idea.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>We possess no means of showing how the religion
of our own progenitors or their brethren of
the continent, had been modified, purified, and
adapted in the course of centuries to a more advanced
state of civilization, or the altered demands
of a higher moral nature; but, at the commencement
of the sixth century we do find the pregnant
fact, that Christianity met but little resistance
among them, and enjoyed an easy triumph, or at
the worst a careless acquiescence, even among those
whose pagan sympathies could not be totally overcome.
Two suppositions, indeed, can alone explain
the facile apostasy to or from Christianity, which
marked the career of the earliest converts. Either
from a conviction of the inefficacy of heathendom
had proceeded a general indifference to religious
sanctions, which does not appear to answer other
conditions of the problem, or the moral demands
of the new faith did not seem to the Saxons more
onerous than those to which they were accustomed;
for it is the amount of self-sacrifice which a religion
successfully imposes upon its votaries, which can
alone form a measure of its influence. The fact
that a god had perished, could sound strangely in
the ears of no worshipper of Baldr; the great message
of consolation,—that he had perished to save
sinful, suffering man,—justified the ways of God,
and added an awful meaning to the old mythus.
An earnest, thinking pagan, would, I must believe,
joyfully accept a version of his own creed, which
offered so inestimable a boon, in addition to what
he had heretofore possessed. The final destruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>of the earth by fire could present no difficulties to
those who had heard of Surtr and the Twilight of
the Gods, or of Allfather’s glorious kingdom, raised
on the ruin of the intermediate divinities. A state
of happiness or punishment in a life to come was
no novelty to him who had shuddered at the idea
of Nástrond: Loki or Grendel had smoothed the
way for Satan. Those who had believed in runes
and incantations were satisfied with the efficacy of
the mass; a crowd of saints might be invoked in
place of a crowd of subordinate divinities; the holy
places had lost none of their sanctity; the holy
buildings had not been levelled with the ground,
but dedicated in another name; the pagan sacrifices
had not been totally abolished, but only converted
into festal occasions, where the new Christians
might eat and drink, and continue to praise God:
Hréðe and Eóstre, Wóden, Tiw and Fricge, Ðunor
and Sætere retained their places in the calendar of
months and days: Erce was still invoked in spells,
Wyrd still wove the web of destiny; and while
Wóden retained his place at the head of the royal
genealogies, the highest offices of the Christian
church were offered to compensate the noble class
for the loss of their old sacerdotal functions. How
should Christianity fail to obtain access where Paganism
stepped half way to meet it, and it could
hold out so many outward points of union to paganism?</p>

<p class='c001'>We dare not question the decrees of omnipotence,
or enquire into the mysterious operations of omniscient
God; it is not for us to measure his infinite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>wisdom by the rules of our finite intelligence, or to
assume that his goodness and mercy can be appreciated
and comprehended by the dim, wavering
light of our reason; but man feels that in every
age man has had a common nature, a common
hope and a common end of being; and we shall do
no wrong either to philosophy or to religion, if we
believe that even in the errors of paganism there
lay the germs of truth; and that the light which
lighteth every one that cometh into the world, was
vouchsafed in such form and measure as best to
subserve the all-wise, all-holy, and all-merciful objects
of creation!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f611'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r611'>611</a>. What Tacitus says of the Germans (Germ, ix.) not having temples
or images is to be taken with great caution. It is clear from other
passages of his own work that some tribes had such, even in his time;
yet if rare then, they may easily have become universal in the course
of two or three centuries, particularly among those tribes whom military
service or commerce had gradually rendered familiar with the
religious rites of Rome.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f612'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r612'>612</a>. These facts are stated in a letter from Gregory to Mellitus, in the
following words: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum ergo Deus omnipotens vos ad reverentissimum
virum fratrem nostrum Augustinum episcopum perduxerit, dicite ei quid
diu mecum de causa Anglorum cogitans tractavi, videlicet, quia fana
idolorum destrui in eadem gente minime debeant; sed ipsa, quae in eis
sunt, idola destruantur, aqua benedicta fiat, in eisdem fanis aspergatur,
altaria construantur, reliquiae ponantur. Quia, si fana eadem bene
constructa sunt, necesse est ut a cultu daemonum in obsequium veri
Dei debeant commutari; ut dum gens ipsa eadem fana sua non videt
destrui, de corde errorem deponat, et Deum verum cognoscens ac
adorans ad loca, quae consuevit, familiarius concurrat. Et quia boves
solent in sacrificio daemonum multos occidere, debet eis etiam hac de
re aliqua solemnitas immutari; ut die dedicationis, vel natalitii sanctorum
martyrum, quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur, tabernacula sibi circa
easdem aecclesias, quae ex fanis commutatae sunt, de ramis arborum
faciant, et religiosis conviviis solemnitatem celebrent, nec diabolo iam
animalia immolent, sed ad laudem Dei in esu suo animalia occidant, et
donatori omnium de satietate sua gratias referant; ut dum eis aliqua
exterius gaudia reservantur, ad interiora gaudia consentire facilius valeant.</span>”

<p class='c001'><a href='#r623'>623</a>. Roger of Wendover appears however to have made a distinction,
which I do not remember to have found in any other author, in the
case of Ælli of Sussex. He says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Wodenus igitur ex antiquorum
prosapia Germanorum originem ducens, post mortem inter deos translatus
est; quem veteres pro deo colentes, dedicaverunt ei quartam feriam,
quam de nomine eius Wodenesday, id est diem Wodeni, nuncuparunt.
Hic habuit uxorem, nomine Fream, cui similiter veteres
sextam feriam consecrantes, Freday, id est diem Freæ, appellarunt.
Genuit autem Wodenus ex uxore Frea septem filios inclytos, ex quorum
successione septem reges traxerunt originem, qui in Britannia potenter,
expulsis Britannis, postea regnaverunt. Ex filio Wodeni primogenito,
nomine Wecta, reges Cantuariorum; ex secundo, Frehegeath, reges
Merciorum; ex tertio, Baldao, reges Westsaxonum; ex quarto, Beldago,
reges Northanhumbrorum, sive Berniciorum; ex quinto, Wegdego,
reges Deirorum; ex sexto, Kasero, reges Orientalium Anglorum;
ex septimo, Saxnad, reges Orientalium Saxonum originem habere dicuntur;

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f624'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r624'>624</a>. It is a peculiarity of the Old-norse to omit the initial W; thus
ormr for wyrmr, a dragon or serpent: ulfr, for wulfr, a wolf: hence
Oþinn is literally Wóden. The identity of Wuotan is clearly shown
in Grimm’s Deut. Mythol. p. 120, <i>seq.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r632'>632</a>. This probably was the case even before any German settlement was
made in Britain. But no argument can be raised on this ground against
the genuineness of the Wóden worship here; because, if the continental
Germans worshiped him, they probably carried his rites with them to
England. We know that he is one of the gods named in the celebrated
formulary of renunciation, which the missionary Christians prepared
for the use of the Saxon converts. Why the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>interpretatio Romana</i></span>
(Tac. Germ. xliii.) fixed upon Wóden as the corresponding god to
Mercury we do not clearly see: but we are not acquainted with the
rites and legends which may have made this perfectly clear to the
Romans.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r679'>679</a>. In the Mirror of June 24th, 1826, there is the account of this having
been done in Perthshire, on occasion of a cattle epidemic. “A
wealthy old farmer, having lost several of his cattle by some disease
very prevalent at present, and being able to account for it in no way
so rationally as by witchcraft, had recourse to the following remedy,
recommended to him by a weird sister in his neighbourhood, as an
effectual protection from the attacks of the foul fiend. A few stones
were piled together in the barnyard, and woodcoals having been laid
thereon, the fuel was ignited by <em>will-fire</em>, that is fire obtained by friction;
the neighbours having been called in to witness the solemnity,
the cattle were made to pass through the flames, in the order of their
dignity and age, commencing with the horses and ending with the
swine. The ceremony having been duly and decorously gone through,
a neighbouring farmer observed to the enlightened owner of the herd,
that he, along with his family, ought to have followed the example of
the cattle, and the sacrifice to Baal would have been complete.” The
<em>will-fire</em> has been used in Devonshire for the same purpose, within the
memory of man.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r699'>699</a>. It is with no disrespect to the unrivalled powers of Scott that I
enter my protest here against the false <em>costume</em> of Ivanhoe; a far more
serious objection no doubt is the way in which his brilliant contrast,
necessary to the success of a romance, has misled the historian. Had
Ivanhoe not appeared, we should not have had the many errors which
disfigure Thierry’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conquête de l'Angleterre par les Normands</span>. But
when Scott makes Ulrica (Ulrica a Saxon female name!) calling upon
Zernebock, as a god of her forefathers, he makes her talk absolute nonsense.
Some Mecklenburg or Pomeranian Saxons, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Slavonic populations, or mingled with them, may
possibly have heard of <em>their</em> god Czerny Bog, (<em>the black god</em>) contrasted
with Bjala Bog, (<em>the white god</em>), but assuredly no Anglosaxon ever
heard the name of any such deity; nor does the chaunt of the vindictive
lady bear one single trace of Saxon character. In every matter of
detail, the romance is only calculated to mislead; and this is to be regretted,
inasmuch as the beauty of the whole work renders it a certain
vehicle of error;—has rendered it already a snare to one estimable author.
M. Thierry has related the effect produced upon his mind by
Ivanhoe. See his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dix Ans d'Études Historiques</span>: Preface.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r724'>724</a>. This is so completely familiar to the student of antiquity, that I
shall not multiply examples: they may be found in Bartholinus. But
one instance I may be excused for citing, inasmuch as it proves how
long the heathen spirit survived despite the peaceful hope and promise
of Christianity. Henry of Huntingdon, in the sixth book of his history,
relates of Sigeweard the great duke of Northumberland, that hearing
of the loss of his son in battle, he exclaimed, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Recepitne vulnus lethale
in anteriori vel posteriori corporis parte? Dixerunt nuntii: In
anteriori. At ille: Gaudeo plane, non enim alio me, vel filium meum
digner funere.</span>” In 1055 however, oppressed with sickness, he found
that his desire was not to be fulfilled. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Siwardus, consul rigidissimus,
profluvio ventris ductus, mortem sensit imminere, dixitque: Quantus
pudor me tot in bellis mori non potuisse, ut vaccarum morti cum dedecore
reservarer! Induite me saltem lorica mea impenetrabili, praecingite
gladio, sublimate galea: scutum in laeva, securim auratam mihi
ponite in dextra, ut militum fortissimus modo militis moriar. Dixerat,
et, ut dixerat, armatus honorifice spiritum exhalavit.</span>” Through every
word of this passage breathes the old heathen spirit of Haralldr Hilditavn,
and one feels that to Christianity alone it was owing, that Sigeweard
did not prevent an inglorious by a voluntary violent death.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f818'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r818'>818</a>. When Loki announced to Freya that Thórr would not recover his
hammer unless she married the giant who had become possessed of it,
she trembled with rage, so that the halls of the gods shook under her,
and the Mén Brísínga burst from her neck: again when Thórr disguises
himself in her distinctive dress, he does not forget the necklace,
Hamarsheimt, xiii. xv. xix. I am inclined to think the Saxon reading
erroneous, and that Brósinga is a mere error of copying. The meaning
of the word is obscure: Brising in Norse denotes a fierce flame, and the
name of the collar has been explained from its bright and burning colour.
Grimm suggests a derivation from a verb <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>brísan</i></span> (found in Middle
German under the form <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>brísen</i></span>) <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nodare</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nodis</i></span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>constringere</i></span>, in reference
to the form of its links. But the main difficulty in my opinion is found
in the plural genitive of the patronymic, and I would almost prefer the
hypothesis of our having entirely lost the lay which described its origin:
others we certainly have lost which had reference to it, as for instance
Loki’s and Heimdallr’s contention for it. Saxo Grammaticus has a
story probably about its origin (p. 13) which is totally unsatisfactory.
Were the Brísingas (sons of fire?) its first possessors or makers?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f819'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r819'>819</a>. I would particularly call attention to W. Grimm’s Deutsche Heldensage,
P. Müller’s Sagabibliothek, and J. Grimm’s Deutsche Mythologie;
the last, a very storehouse of all that bears upon this
most interesting and important subject, important whether we consider
it merely in a literary point of view, or in the far higher one of a revelation
of the creed of our forefathers, the sources of their hope and fear,
the basis of their moral being and directing motive of their actions. If
it be true that nothing human can be without interest for a man, surely
that which tells of the religious belief of our forefathers must be of the
deepest and nearest interest. It has had something to do with making
us what we are.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>There are two slight causes of inaccuracy to be borne in mind
in using the foregoing tables: the first arises from the insertion of
names which probably do not, the other from the omission of
names which probably do, belong to this class. But I think these
two errors may nearly balance one another, and that they do not
interfere with the general correctness of the results.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is remarkable how many of these names still stand <i>alone</i>,
without any addition of -wíc, -hám, -worðig, or similar words. The
total number of patronymical names thus found (in the nominative
plural) is 190, or very nearly one-seventh of the whole; they are
thus distributed: in Kent, 25; Norfolk and Sussex each 24;
Essex 21; Suffolk 15; Yorkshire 13; Lincoln 7; Southampton
6; Berks and Surrey, 5 each; Bedfordshire, Lancashire, Middlesex
and Northampton, 4 each; Hertford, Huntingdon, Northumberland
and Nottingham, 3 each; Cambridge, Derby, Dorset,
Gloucester and Oxford, 2 each; Bucks, Devon, Leicester, Salop,
Somerset, Warwick, and Wilts, 1 each; and none at all in the remaining
ten counties. When now we consider that of 190 such
places, 140 are found in the counties on the eastern and southern
coasts; and that 22 more are in counties easily accessible
through our great navigable streams, we shall be led to admit
the possibility of these having been the original seats of the
Marks bearing these names; and the further possibility of the
settlements distinguished by the addition of -hám, -wíc and so forth
to these original names, having been filial settlements, or as it
were colonies, from them. It also seems worthy of remark that
they are hardly found to the north of the Humber, or about
53° 40´ N. Lat., which renders it probable that the prevailing
mode of emigration was to take advantage of a N.E. wind to secure
a landing in the Wash, and thence coast southward and westward
as far as circumstances required. Sailors, who in the ninth century
could find their way from Norway to Iceland in sufficient
numbers to colonize that island, who in the tenth could extend
their course from Iceland to Greenland, and who had noble spirit
enough to confront the perils of the Polar ocean rather than submit
to oppression at home, were not likely to find any insurmountable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>difficulty in a voyage from the Elbe or Skager Rack to England:
and the conquest of the Orkneys and Hebrides, of the south of
Ireland and Man, nay of large tracts of England by the Scandinavians
in the ninth, tenth and following centuries, may supply
the means of judging how similar adventures were conducted by
populations of the same race, and as noble spirit, nine hundred or
a thousand years before.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following additions may be made to the evidences given in
this chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>A <em>marked</em> linden or lime-tree is noticed in Cod. Dipl. No. 1317.
Again in Kent we hear of earnes beám, the eagle’s tree, <i>ibid.</i>
No. 287: it is more probable that this was a tree marked with the
figure of an eagle, than that a real bird of that species should
have been meant. Further in the boundary of the charter No.
393 we have, on ðán merkeden ók, to the <em>marked oak</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sacred woods are again mentioned by Tacitus, Annal, i. 59,
where he tells us that Arminius hung up the captured Roman
ensigns to the gods of the country, in the woods, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lucis</i></span>: we hang
them up in cathedrals. See also Tac. Germ, vii., Annal. iv.
22.</p>

<p class='c001'>The character of the Mark or March is very evident in the following
passage: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Siquidem in Lindeseia superiori extat prioratus
qui Marchby dicitur, longas ac latas pasturas pro gregibus alendis
inhabitans, non omnino privato iure, sed communem cum compatriotis
libertatem ex dono patronorum participans,</span>” etc. Chron.
Lanerc. an. 1289. See also the quotations from the Indiculus
Pagan. and Synod. Leptin. an. 742, in Möser, Osnab. i. 52, and
the whole of his twenty-ninth chapter, for the religious rites with
which boundaries were dedicated, especially vol. i. p. 58, note <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is more than one could now undertake to do, without such
local co-operation as is not to be expected in England as yet, but I
am certain that the ancient Marks might still be traced. In looking
over a good county map we are surprised by seeing the systematic
succession of places ending in -den, -holt, -wood, -hurst,
-fold, and other words which invariably denote forests and outlying
pastures in the woods. <em>These are all in the Mark</em>, and within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>them we may trace with equal certainty, the -háms, -túns, -worðigs
and -stedes which imply settled habitations. There are few counties
which are not thus distributed into districts, whose limits may
be assigned by the observation of these peculiar characteristics.
I will lay this down as a rule, that the ancient Mark is to be recognised
by following the names of places ending in -den (neut.),
which always denoted <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cubile ferarum</i></span>, or pasture, usually for
swine. Denu, a valley (fem.), a British and not Saxon word, is
very rarely, perhaps never, found in composition. The actual
surface of the island, wherever the opportunity has been given of
testing this hypothesis, confirms its history. But there are other
remarkable facts bearing upon this subject, which are only to be
got at by those who are fortunate enough to have free access to
manorial records, before the act of Charles II. destroyed all feudal
services in England. A striking example of the mark-jurisdiction
is the “Court of Dens,” in Kent. This appears to have been a
mark-court, in the sense in which mark-court is used throughout
this second chapter, and which gradually became a lord’s court,
only when the head markman succeeded in raising himself at the
expense of his fellows: a court of the little marks, marches, or
pastures in Kent, long after the meaning of such marks or marches
had been forgotten: a court which in earlier times met to regulate
the rights of the markmen in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dens</i></span> or pastures. I am indebted
(among many civilities, which I gratefully acknowledge) to the
Rev. L. Larking of Ryarsh for the following extracts from Sir
Roger Twisden’s journal, which throw some light upon what the
court had become in the middle of the seventeenth century, but
still show its existence, and lead us to a knowledge of its ancient
form.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reader who feels how thoroughly English liberty has become
grounded in the struggles between the duties and privileges of
various classes, how entirely the national right has been made up
and settled by the conflict of private rights, how impossible it
was for the union of empire and freedom to exist,—or for <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>imperium</i></span>
and freedom to co-exist, without the battle in which the
several autocracies measured their forces and discovered the just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>terms of compromise,—will value this record of the reluctance
with which a staunch country squire submitted to the duties of
his position. It is not only amusing, but instructive, to watch
these men of the seventeenth century, fighting on the minutest
grounds of squabble: very amusing, to those who take the world
as it is, to have been always as it is, and likely always so to remain:
very instructive to those who know the miserable condition
from which such “squabbles” have raised us. There are people,
who having no sense of right, but a profound sense of the wrong
done <em>them</em>, raise barricades, and overturn dynasties in moments of
irrepressible and pardonable excitement: there are people on the
other hand who steadily and coolly measure right and wrong, who
take to the law-book rather than the sword, who argue the question
of ship-money, on which a system of government depends, as
calmly as if it were a question of poor-rates in a parish attorney’s
hands, and having brought their right, the ancient right of the
land, into light, fall back into the orderly frame of society in
which they lived before, as if no years of desperate struggle had
intervened,—the law being vindicated, and the work of the workmen
done. This work without distinction of Parliamentarian or
King’s Man was done by the Seldens and the Twisdens, and men
of more general note and name, but not more claim to our gratitude
and respect. But to do this, required that study which unhappily
our English gentlemen no longer think absolutely necessary
to their education, the study of the law, of which they are
the guardians, though a professional class may be its ministers;
and most amusing now it is to see how zealously these old champions
of the law did battle in its defence, even in the most minute
and now unimportant details. It was then a happy thing for
England that there were courts of Dens, and squires who did not
like them: it is now an admirable thing for England that there
are courts of all sorts and descriptions, and people who do not
like them, who are constantly trying their right against them,
constantly winning and losing at the great game of law, or perhaps
the greater game, of the forms under which law is administered,—litigious
people,—people liking to argue the right and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>the wrong in a strict form of logic, the legal form; who are
always arguing, and therefore never fighting. If there had not
been courts of Dens to argue about,—and unhappily, at last, to
fight about,—there would most certainly not now be a “High
Court of Parliament,” for there would never have been those
who knew how to establish it. The country-gentlemen of the
seventeenth century appeal to the experience of the nineteenth, in
every land but this of England, whose steady, legal order the
country-gentlemen of the seventeenth century founded; and the
grateful middle class of the nineteenth century in no country but
this respond to that appeal in this year 1848, by declaring that no
force, whether of king or not of king, shall be known in England,
except that of the law,—the great and ancient law,—that all associations
of men are united in a guarantee of mutual peace and
security.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is now time to return to Sir R. Twisden and the Court of
Dens. It appears that this was held at Aldington, and that it
claimed jurisdiction over a considerable space. If we follow the
main road from Hythe to Maidstone, a little to the north of
Aldington<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c008'><sup>[837]</sup></a>, and running to the east of Boughton, we find a tract
of country extending to the borders of Sussex and filled with
places ending in -den, or -hurst; this country of the Dens runs
exactly where we should expect to find it, viz. along the edge of
the Weald, within whose shades the <em>swains</em> found mast and pasture.
I will enumerate a few of the places so named: they can
readily be found on a good map of Kent, and form a belt of mark
or forest round the cultivated country, quite independent of the
woods which once lay between village and village.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not likely that all these various places, the list of which
might be greatly increased, were ever reduced under one judicial
unity; but, even with the aid of Sussex, I have been able to mention
only twenty-five <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dens</i></span>, and we know that at least thirty-two,
if not forty-four, were subject to the court of Aldington.</p>

<p class='c001'>The entries in Twisden’s Journal are to the following effect:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“18th September 1655. I was at Aldyngton Court, at the
chusing the officers to gather the Lord’s Rent, where grew a
question, whither, if the Lord released our Rent, Sute, and Service,
to the Court, we were subject to the slavery of attendance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>and whither the Tenants could prescribe men, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., or
impose an office upon them,—and it was the whole resolution of
the Court, the Lord might sell his quit-rents and all manner of
attendance on the Court, and then he could not be tyed to any
office, nor the Tenants impose any office upon him....</p>

<p class='c001'>“The 16th September 1656, I went to Aldyngton Court, but
came too late, there beeing layd on me the office for collecting the
32 Denns, for my land in them. I desired to know what land it
was ... in the 32 Dens upon which the office was laid, but this I
could not learn ... the issue was, that if they can name the land
or descry it, I am to do it,—if not, I refused to gather it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“1658. I was at Aldynton Court again, and then there was
much stir about this land which could not bee found. I still
insisted the Denne of Plevynden held of Wye, that the 16<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
<i>ob.</i> I payd was for light money in time past. The Conclusion was,
They will distrain me if they can find the land, and then come to
a trial in their Court which is held at Smethe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“1659. I was at Aldington Court, where I came before the
Steward sate, yet were they then chusing for the 32 Denns, and
Mr. Short brought me a note for chusing Mr. John Maynard,
Serg<sup>t</sup> at Law ... he was not chosen after the ancient custom of
the Court, that is, to present two to the Steward, and he to take
one.... The tenants of the 12 Denns pretended if it were sometime
a Custom it had been long interrupted, and refused to follow
the example of the 32 ... after dinner, this grew a great dispute,
Mr. Short complaining of partiality, that the choice of one man
was received for the 12 and not for the 32 Dennes. This drew
on the manner of chusing of the 32 Dennes, which was, that they
usually met at 9 o’clock long before the Steward himself could
reach the Court, made choice of one man before there was a
Court.... This brought forth an excellent order, that the Denns
should chuse and present the person by them chosen after the
manner the other Culets did.... Coming away, the Bailiff told
me he had a writ to distreyn me for the rent of the 32 Denns. I
told him I had no land held of it that I knew.... Sir Edward
Sydnam, Lord of the Manor, and who is to answer the rents to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>the Exchequer, told me I would be distreyned for it,—my answer
was, I was not willing to make my land chargeable with a burthen
more than my ancestors had paid—that there was a Court of
Survey to be kept in the Spring,—that if I could not then discharge
myself of having land, held of the 32 Denns, I would and
must pay it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aldington Court. 1664. S<sup>r</sup> John Maynard Serg<sup>t</sup> at Law was
chosen to the Great Office though it were affirmed, he being
Kings Serg<sup>t</sup> would procure a discharge. The order before mentioned
of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for such Culets as received from the Steward a
transcript of what they were to collect, and 10<i>s.</i> for the Great
Office was at this Court willingly assented to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This determined refusal of a Markgraviat in the Mark of Kent
is amusing enough; the Alberts, Berchtholds and Luitpolts did
not make quite so much difficulty about Brandenburg, Baden or
Ancona. How the dispute ended I do not know, but the right
was not in question: all that Sir Roger doubted was its applicability
to himself. Still the nature of the jurisdiction seems clear
enough, and the transition of an old Mark Court into a Lord’s
Court, with a steward, is obvious from the custom of the Tenants
chusing “before the Steward himself could reach the Court;” the
abolition of which, Sir Roger naturally considered an excellent
thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have intentionally selected one or two examples where the
whole acreage exactly makes up the sum of hides multiplied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>120, because it is probable that such instances may have led to
that calculation: but it is necessary to bear in mind that the Híd
is exclusively <em>arable</em> land, and that in the case where the number
of hides equalled the whole acreage, there could have been neither
forest, nor meadow nor pasture. The notes on some of the entries
will show how erroneous any such calculation would necessarily
be. And lest this assertion that the híd is exclusive of unbroken
land should appear unsupported, I wish the following data to be
considered. But first we must see how the híd is distributed into
its component parts. In Domesday the híd consists of four yard-lands,
virga or virgata: and the virga of four farthings or farlings,
ferlingus, ferlinus, ferdinus, fertinus: thus</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>Now it is particularly necessary to bear in mind that these ridiculous
amounts are the minimum; that in every case the arable
land remains to be added to them, and in some cases whole square
miles of forest and moorland. I conclude then that the wood,
meadow and pasture were not included in the híd or arable, but
were appurtenant to it. Sometimes indeed they bear a very small
proportion to the arable, and to the number of cattle owned—a
fact perhaps to be explained by the existence of extensive commons.</p>

give examples, because they may be found in every other entry in
Domesday; but I may add that the gyld or tax payable to the

<p class='c001'>It will now be seen why I have given a column in which the whole
acreage was measured by a calculation of forty acres to the híd.
That this result is a near approximation to the truth appears from
the following considerations. In the Cornish Domesday, (a county
where arable land bore a very small proportion to the markland,
forest and pasture,) there are a great number of estates, valued at
one ager or acre. These are generally said to pay geld for half a
ferling. Thus in Treuurniuet, one ager paid geld for half a ferling<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c008'><sup>[846]</sup></a>:
so in Penquaro<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c008'><sup>[847]</sup></a>, in Trelamar<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c008'><sup>[848]</sup></a>, in Lantmatin<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c008'><sup>[849]</sup></a>, in Chilo<sup>r</sup>goret<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c008'><sup>[850]</sup></a>,
in Roslet<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c008'><sup>[851]</sup></a>, in Pengelli<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c008'><sup>[852]</sup></a>, in Telbricg<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c008'><sup>[853]</sup></a>, in Karsalan<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c008'><sup>[854]</sup></a>, in
Dimelihoc<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c008'><sup>[855]</sup></a>; and similarly in Widewot, two agri paid geld for
one ferling<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c008'><sup>[856]</sup></a>. Now throughout Domesday there are innumerable
examples of land being rated at less than its real value, or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>at its real value; but I have not detected any instance in which
it is rated at more: and in Cornwall especially the rating seems
to have been in favour of the tenant. I do not therefore believe
that one ager was <em>less</em> than half a ferling: it was either more
than half a ferling or equal to it. But ½ ferl. = 1¼ Norman acre,
which is more than one statute acre; therefore we may conclude
that the ager or acre was equal to half a ferling. The way I understand
this, is by the assumption that the Saxon acre was somewhat
larger than the Norman: we know that they differed in
point of extent<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c008'><sup>[857]</sup></a>, and it is possible that the original Saxon calculation
was founded upon multiples of eight, while the Norman was
reduced to a decimal notation: if this were so, we may believe
that the híd was the unit, and that its principal subdivisions remained,
being <a id='corr491.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='familar'>familiar</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_491.14'><ins class='correction' title='familar'>familiar</ins></a></span> to the people, but that the value of the acre
was slightly changed. Hence that the</p>

<p class='c001'>The document entituled “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rectitudines singularum personarum</span>”
says<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c008'><sup>[858]</sup></a>, that the poor settler on first coming in, ought to have seven
acres laid down for him in seed, out of his yardland; and the
same authority implies that his grass-land was usually short of
his need: this it might be, if he had only one acre to support
the two oxen and one cow with which his land was stocked on
entry. The lot of meadow and pasture attached to these small
plots of one ager, is so frequently quoted at thirty agri, in Cornwall,
that one could almost imagine an enclosure-bill to have been
passed just previous to the Conquest, under which the possession
of even so small a quantity as one acre qualified the owner to receive
a handsome share of the waste.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is obvious that all these calculations are ultimately founded
upon the value of the acre relatively to our own statute measure,
in which the survey of 1841 is expressed. That ager and acra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>are equivalent terms appears from their being used interchangeably
in various entries of Domesday. Nor is there any good reason
to suppose that the Normans made any violent change in the
values of these several denominations, although they might adopt
more convenient subdivisions of the larger sums. They did just
the same thing in respect to the Saxon money. Besides, as it was
from the Saxons that they derived the information which the Survey
contains, it is reasonable to believe that the Saxon values were
generally adopted, at least as far as the híd was concerned. The
minute subdivision of land consequent upon the Conquest probably
rendered it necessary to pay especial attention to the smaller units,
and I can conceive nothing more likely than a slight change in the
value of the acre, while the híd and virgate remained unaltered.
Then where an estate comprised only one Saxon acre, it might
readily be considered equal to half a ferling, or 1¼ acre, Norman
measure, for it would have been difficult and complicated to express
it in other terms. In fact where small fractional parcels of land
were to be subtracted, the Commissioners were generally glad to
avoid details, and enter “A. has so much in demesne, and the
Villani have aliam terram, <em>the rest of the land</em>.” If the Saxon
ager paid for half a ferling in the time of the Confessor, it was
likely to be taken at that value in the Survey; for the law, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quæ
de minimis non curat</i></span>, could hardly notice so trifling a deviation.
The approximate value of the Saxon acre, however, I have given;
it was one day’s work for a plough and oxen, in other words very
nearly our own statute-acre.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the value of the hide became gradually indistinct, when
reckonings ceased to be made in it, and the calculation was taken
upon knights’ fees, is very intelligible. We consequently find
surprising variations in the amount of hides counted to a knight’s
fee, as well as the acres contained in this last measure. In the
time of Edward the Third it was computed that there were 60,215
knight’s fees in England, which taking the present acreage of
31,770,615 gives rather more than 527 acres to a fee: hence those
who believed a hide to contain 100 acres, calculated five hides to
a knight’s fee, in accordance with the Saxon law which made that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>amount the minimum of a thane’s estate, and also to the entries
in Domesday, from which it appeared that one <em>miles</em> went from
five hides: but here it was overlooked that the hide was exclusively
<em>arable</em> land. To such erroneous modes of calculation we owe
such entries as the following:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Now either these figures cannot be relied on, or we must carry
the hide in this calculation to a very different amount. If we
take it at 100 acres, we shall find the whole hidage of these thirteen
counties amounts to 25,300 × 100 or 2,530,000 acres, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>whole actual acreage is 7,669,905; giving an excess of 5,139,905,
and consequently a ratio of 25:51 nearly, or 1:2. This would
a little exceed the present ratio, which is 5:11, a result which
appears very improbable indeed in the reign of Henry III. But
when we consider the numberless errors of transcription, so unavoidable
where merely numbers, and not words, are given, and the
totally inconsistent accounts contained in different manuscripts,
we can hardly rest satisfied that the figures themselves are trustworthy.
Even on the hypothesis that in the time of Henry III.
or Edward I. the hide was calculated on the new footing of 100
acres, we yet could not reconcile the conflicting amounts assigned
to the counties themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This writing witnesseth that Orcy hath granted the guildhall
at Abbotsbury and the site thereof, to the honour of God and St.
Peter, and for a property to the guild, both during his life and
after his life, for a long lasting commemoration of himself and his
consort. Let him that would set it aside, answer it to God in the
great day of judgment!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now these are the covenants which Orcy and the guildsmen of
Abbotsbury have ordained, to the honour of God, the worship of
St. Peter, and the hele of their own souls. Firstly; three days
before St. Peter’s mass, from each guildbrother one penny, or one
pennyworth of wax,—look which the minster most needeth; and
on the mass eve, from every two guildbrothers one broad loaf,
well sifted and well raised, towards our common alms; and five
weeks before Peter’s mass, let each guildbrother contribute one
guildsester full of clean wheat, and let this be paid within two
days, on forfeiture of the entrance, which is three sesters of wheat.
And let the wood be paid within three days after the corn-contribution,
from every full guildbrother one load of wood, and
from those who are not full brothers, two; or let him pay one
guildsester of corn. And let him that undertaketh a charge
and performeth it not accordingly, be mulcted in the amount of
his entrance; and be there no remission. And if one brother misgreet
another within the guild, in hostile temper, let him atone
for it to all the fellowship with the amount of his entrance, and
after that to him whom he misgreeted, as they two may arrange:
and if he will not bend to compensation, let him lose our fellowship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>and every other advantage of the guild. And let him that
introduceth more guests than he ought, without leave of the steward
and the caterers, forfeit his entrance. And if any of our fellowship
should pass away from us, let each brother contribute a
penny over the corpse for the soul’s hele or pay ... brothers:
and if any one of us should be afflicted with sickness within
sixty ... we are to find fifteen men who shall fetch him,
and if he be dead, thirty, and they shall bring him to the place
which he desired to go to, while he lived. And if he die in this
present place, let the steward have warning to what place the
corpse is to go; and let the steward warn the brethren, the greatest
number that he can ride or send to, that they shall come thither and
worthily accompany the corpse and bear it to the minster, and
earnestly pray there for the soul. It is rightly ordained a guildship
if we do thus, and well fitting it is both toward God and
man: for we know not which of us shall first depart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now we have faith through God’s assistance, that the aforesaid
ordinance, if we rightly maintain it, shall be to the benefit of
us all. Let us earnestly from the bottom of our hearts beseech
Almighty God to have mercy upon us, and also his holy apostle
St. Peter to make intercession for us, and take our way unto eternal
rest, because for his sake we have gathered this guild together:
he hath the power in heaven to admit into heaven whomso he
will, and to exclude whomso he will not, even as Christ himself
spake unto him in his gospel: Peter, I give to thee the keys of
heaven, and whatsoever thou wilt have bound on earth, the same
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou wilt have unbound
on earth, the same shall be unbound in heaven. Let us have
hope and trust in him, that he will guide us here in this world,

<h4 class='c042'>THE GUILD AT EXETER.</h4>

<p class='c021'>“This assembly was collected in Exeter, for the love of God, and
for our soul’s need, both in regard to our health of life here, and
to the after days, which we desire for ourselves by God’s doom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>Now we have agreed that our meeting shall be thrice in the twelve
months; once at St. Michael’s Mass, secondly at St. Mary’s Mass,
after midwinter, and thirdly at Allhallows Mass after Easter; and
let each gild-brother have two sesters of malt, and each young
man<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c008'><sup>[860]</sup></a> one sester, and a sceat of honey; and let the mass-priest at
each of our meetings sing two masses, one for our living friends,
the other for the dead: and let each brother of common condition
sing two psalters of psalms, one for the living and one for the
dead; and at the death of a brother, each man six masses, or six
psalters of psalms; and at a death, each man five pence; and at
a houseburning each man one penny. And if any one neglect the
day, for the first time three masses, for the second five, and at the
third time let him have no favour, unless his neglect arose from
sickness or his lord’s need. And if any one neglect his subscription
at the proper day let him pay double. And if any one of this
brotherhood misgreet another, let him make boot with thirty
pence. Now we pray for the love of God that every man hold
this meeting rightly, as we rightly have agreed upon it. God
help us thereunto.”</p>

<h4 class='c042'>THE GUILD AT CAMBRIDGE.</h4>

<p class='c021'>“In this writ is the notification of the agreement which this brotherhood
hath made in the thanes’ gild of Grantabrycg. That is
first, that each gave oath upon the relics to the rest, that he would
hold true brotherhood for God and for the world, and all the brotherhood
to support him that hath the best right. If any gild-brother
die, all the gildship is to bring him where he desired to
lie; and let him that cometh not thereto pay a sester of honey;
and let the gildship inherit of the dead half a farm, and each gild-brother
contribute two pence to the alms, and out of this sum let
what is fitting be taken to St. Æðelðrýð. And if any gild-brother
have need of his fellows’ aid, and it be made known to the reeve
nearest the gild (unless the gild-brother himself be nigh) and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>reeve neglect it, let him pay one pound; if the lord neglect it, let
him pay a pound, unless he be on his lord’s need or confined to
his bed. And if any one steal from a gild-brother, let there be no
boot, but eight pounds. But if the outlaw neglect this boot, let
all the gildship avenge their comrade; and let all bear it, if one
misdo; let all bear alike. And if any gild-brother slay a man,
and if he be a compelled avenger and compensate for his insult,
and the slain man be a twelve-hundred man, let each gild-brother
assist ... if the slain be a ceorl, two
ores; if he be a Welshman, one ore. But if the gild-brother
with folly and deceit slay a man, let him bear his own deed; and
if a comrade slay another comrade through his own folly, let him
bear his breach as regards the relatives of the slain; and let him
buy back his brotherhood in the gild with eight pounds, or lose
for ever our brotherhood and friendship. And if a gild-brother
eat or drink with him that slew his comrade, save in the presence
of the king, the bishop or the ealdorman, let him pay a pound, unless
he can clear himself with two of his dependents, of any knowledge
of the fact. If any comrade misgreet another, let him pay
a sester of honey, except he can clear himself with his two dependents.
If a servant draw a weapon, let his lord pay a pound,
and recover what he can from the servant, and let all the company
aid him to recover his money. And if a servant wound another,
let the lord avenge it, and the company, so that seek what he may
seek, he shall not have his life. And if a servant sit within the
spence, let him pay a sester of honey, and if any one hath a footsitter
let him do the same. And if any gild-brother die or lie
sick out of the country, let his gild-brethren fetch him alive or
dead, to the place where he desired to lie, under the same penalty
as we have before said, in case of a comrade’s dying at home, and
a gild-brother neglecting to attend the corpse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following document, which seems justly referable to the
reign of Eádgár, that is to the close of the tenth century, gives
the regulations under which the Hundred was constituted<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c008'><sup>[861]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>“This is the Ordinance how the Hundred shall be held.</p>

<p class='c001'>“First that they meet every four weeks, and that each man do
right to other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That a thief be pursued, if necessary. If there be present need,
let it be told to the hundredman, and let him afterwards make it
known to the tithingmen, and let them all go forth whither God
may direct them to their end: let them do justice on the thief as
it was formerly Eádmund’s law. And be the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>ceápgild</i></span> paid to
him that owns the chattel; and be the rest divided in two, half to
the hundred, half to the lord, except men; and let the lord take
possession of the men.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if any man neglect this, and deny the judgment of the
hundred, and the same be afterwards proved against him, let him
pay to the hundred thirty pence; and the second time, sixty
pence; half to the hundred, half to the lord. If he do it a third
time, let him pay half a pound: the fourth time, let him lose all
that he hath, and be an outlaw, unless the king will allow him to
remain in the land.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we have ordained respecting unknown cattle, that no man
should have it without the witness of the hundredman or the
tithingman; and that he be a well trusty man; and unless he
have one or other of these, let no vouching to warranty be allowed
him<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c008'><sup>[862]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have also ordained, that, if the hundred pursue a track
into another hundred, notice be given to the hundredman, and
that he then go with them. If he neglect this, let him pay thirty
shillings to the king.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If any one flinch from justice and escape, let him that had him
in custody pay the <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>angild</i></span>. And if he be accused of having aided
the escape, let him clear himself according to the custom of the
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the hundred as in every other <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><i>gemót</i></span>, we ordain that folkright
be pronounced in every suit, and that a term be appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>when it shall be fulfilled. And if any one break that term, unless
it be through the lord’s decree, let him make amends with
thirty shillings, and on a set day fulfil that which he should have
done before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“An ox’s bell, and a dog’s collar, and a blast horn, each of these
three shall be worth a shilling, and each is reckoned <em>an informer</em>.</p>

there was also land not geldable which sufficed for 20 ploughs; and the 20

we ought to reckon not 30 but 33⅓ hides in Pilton, which at 30 acres would
give 1000 arable; at 40 would give 1333⅓, while the whole acreage is but 1210.
This would exclude the calculation of 40 acres; but we cannot trust the merely

qui per nostrum beneficium aecclesiam dei fraude, seu in sua possessione
aut servitio debito privare temptaverit, ipse nostra omnique
benedictione dei et sanctorum eius privetur, nisi profundissima
emendatione illud corrigere studeat et ad pristinum statum quod defraudavit

After king Eádmund, king Eádred booked it to Ælfstán as an inheritance for ever: now after Ælfstán’s day, Ælfheáh his son was his heir, and that he proved with a whole tongue, and deprived Ælfríc his brother both of land and chattels, but what he might deserve at his hands. Now for brotherly love he granted him Erith, Cray, Ænesford, and Wouldham, for his life. Then Ælfheáh survived his brother, and re-entered on his lǽn: but Ælfríc had a son called Eádríc, and Ælfheáh had none. Then Ælfheáh granted to Eádríc Erith, Cray, and Wouldham, and kept Ænesford for himself. Now Eádríc died before Ælfheáh without making a will, and Ælfheáh re-entered on his lǽn. Eádríc had a widow but no child; then Ælfheáh granted her her <em>morning-gift</em>, at Cray; and Erith, Wouldham and Littlebrook stood on his lǽn. When he bethought him, he took his feorm at Wouldham, and meant<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span> so to do at the other places, but he fell ill, and sent to archbishop Dúnstán, and he came to him at Scylf: and Ælfheáh declared his will before him, and he deposited one will at Christchurch, another at St. Andrews, and the third copy he gave his widow. But afterwards Leofsunu broke through the will, through the wife he married, namely Eádríc’s widow, and set at nought the archbishop’s testimony, and rode in upon the land with the woman, without any judgment of the witan. Now when this was reported to the bishop, he took all the claims of <a id='corr521.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='owership'>ownership</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_521.19'><ins class='correction' title='owership'>ownership</ins></a></span> under Ælfheáh’s will, to Erith, in witness of Ælfstán bishop of London, and all the convent, and that at Christchurch, and Ælfstán bishop of Rochester, and Wulfsige the priest who was sheriff, and Bryhtwald of Mereworth, and all the men of East Kent and of West Kent. And it was well known in Sussex and Wessex, and Middlesex and Essex, that the archbishop with his own oath upon the cross of Christ, recovered the land which Leofsunu had invaded, together with the books, for God and St. Andrew. And Wulfsige the sheriff received the oath, since he would not go to the king’s hand: and there was a good addition of a thousand men who gave the oath.<br />   <em>Rubric.</em> Thus were the six ploughlands at Wouldham given to St. Andrew at Rochester.”</td>

<p class='c001'>The well- and tree-worship noticed in these laws continued to
be retained, though in a somewhat altered form, until a very late
period; and especially it was usual to perform religious ceremonies
at the salt-springs, spots always looked upon as holy<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c008'><sup>[863]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The confessional however was more likely to be in the secret of
the popular heathendom than the civil legislator. Accordingly
the Poenitentials supply us with a variety of information upon this
subject. The Poenitential of Theodore has a long chapter devoted
to the heathen practices of communicants, and their appropriate
penances.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>The points principally noted here are, sacrificing to dæmons, that

making philacteries or philtres. Other forms may be gathered

<p class='c021'>The Saxon version in the MS. at Brussels, applies this to other
illness besides fever: “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Gif hwylc wíf seteð hire bearn ofer hróf

<p class='c001'>This “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">stacan drífan</span>” or “<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">stacung</span>” is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>invultuatio</i></span> which
has been explained in the text, and of which an example has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>given from a charter of Eádgár. Mr. Thorpe’s explanation of
Stacung is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><em>Stácung</em></span>, a sticking. The practice of sticking pins or needles
into a waxen image of the person against whom the witchcraft
was directed, consisted probably at first in sticking them actually
into the body of the individual, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">‘gif hwá drífe stácan on ǽnigne
man;’</span> but as this process was no doubt sometimes attended with
inconvenience and danger to the operator, the easier and safer
method was devised of substituting a waxen proxy, instead of the
true man. This practice was known under the name of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>defixio</i></span>,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘quod eiusmodi incantores acus subinde <em>defigerent</em> in imagines
cereas, iis locis quibus viros ipsos pungere decreverant, qui puncturas
ipsas, ac si ipsi pungerentur persentiebant.’</span> Du Cange. To
it Ovid alludes:</p>

practices:—</p>

<p class='c001'>The Canons enacted under Eádgár give the following full details
of popular heathendom<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c008'><sup>[870]</sup></a>:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we enjoin, that every priest zealously promote Christianity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>and totally extinguish every heathenism; and forbid well-worshippings,

man-worshippings, and the vain practices which are carried on with
various spells, and with ‘<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">frithsplots,</span>’ and with elders, and also
with various other trees, and with stones, and with many various
delusions, with which men do much of what they should not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Many of these heathen practices still continue to subsist, at
least in the memory and traditions of the peasantry in remote parts
of England. Devonshire, for example, still offers an unexhausted
field for the <a id='corr528.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='collecter'>collector</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_528.10'><ins class='correction' title='collecter'>collector</ins></a></span> both of popular superstitions and popular

<p class='c001'>A large analytical table spanning pp. 106-107 has been split into multiple
tables, and the first column (containing county names) repeated
in each. It has also been moved to fall on a paragraph break.</p>

<p class='c001'>On two occasions (‘downfal’ and ‘recal’), a second ‘l’ has been added,
though it’s possible that each was spelled with an obsolete variant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original,
not counting any embedded tables. Where a third reference is employed,
the reference is to the line within the designated footnote (e.g. 166.1.1
refers to the first line in the first footnote on p. 166, as printed).</p>
